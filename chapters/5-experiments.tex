        \label{subsec::experiments::datasets::scenes}
        \gls{acr::3d} models from three different cities of France are selected in order to assess the performance of our framework: \textbf{Elancourt}, \textbf{Nantes}, and the XIII\textsuperscript{th} district of Paris (\textbf{Paris-13}) (\textit{cf.} Figure~\ref{fig::france_map}).
        Figure~\ref{fig::elancourt_ortho} depicts the small city of \textbf{Elancourt} which contains diverse of building types: residential areas with gable and hip roof buildings and large industrial flat roof building based districts (\textit{cf.} Subfigure~\ref{subfig::elancourt_samples}).
        \textbf{Nantes}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig::nantes_ortho}, represents a denser urban setting but with a lower building diversity (\textit{cf.} Subfigure~\ref{subfig::nantes_samples}).
        In Figure~\ref{fig::paris-13_ortho}, one can see how \textbf{Paris-13} consists of mostly flat roof high towers which coexist with Haussmann style buildings that typically exhibit highly fragmented roofs (\textit{cf.} Subfigure~\ref{subfig::paris-13_samples}).
        The \textbf{Elancourt} (\textit{resp.} \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Paris-13}) scene contains 2,009 (\textit{resp.} 748 and 478) annotated building models.
        The \gls{acr::dsm} as well as the orthorectified image resolution is \SI{6}{\cm} for the first area while it is \SI{10}{\cm} for the other ones.

        \gls{acr::3d} models were generated using the algorithm described in~\parencite{durupt2006automatic}, out of existing building footprints and aerial VHR multi-view \glspl{acr::dsm}.
        The modeling algorithm simulates possible roof structures with facets satisfying some geometric constraints.
        The best configuration is selected using a scoring system on the extrapolated roofs.
        Finally, vertical building fa\c{c}ades connect the optimal roof to the building footprint.
        These models have a \gls{acr::lod}-2 level.
        This method is adapted to roof types of low complexity and favors symmetrical models that are common in residential areas.
        It has been selected to ensure a varying error rate for the three areas of interest, especially since models were generated with partly erroneous cadastral maps.
        3,235 buildings in total are considered.
        They were annotated according to the atomic errors list provided by our taxonomy.

    \subsection{\textsc{Error statistics}}
        \label{subsec::experiments::datasets::stats}

        Some of the models obtained using the previous datasets were annotated manually in order to build training datasets.
        To annotate a building model, the manual operator compares the nadir projection of the model to the corresponding orthoimage and \gls{acr::dsm}.
        This was possible thanks to the work\footnote{\href{https://github.com/CHUPClem/sGrISner.git}{GIS Graphical interface for annotation.}} of Cl√©mence Chupin, who was a Master student at \gls{acr::ensg}.
        Figure~\ref{fig::error_statistics} reports modeling errors statistics over the annotated buildings.

                }
            }
        \end{figure}

        These statistics are first analysed depending on the family errors at the \texttt{finesse} = 2 level (\textit{cf.} Figure~\ref{fig::family_errors}).
        Due to the fact that geometrically inconsistent \gls{acr::3d} models were filtered out in a preprocessing (nadir projection) step, \texttt{Unqualifiable} buildings represent a small fraction of the dataset ($<$ 7.5\%).
        Actually, this latter corresponds to the, partially or completly, occluded buildings that could not be qualified.
        Moreover, only a small fraction of buildings are \texttt{Valid}:
        57 (2.84\%) in \textbf{Elancourt}, 55 (7.35\%) for \textbf{Nantes} and 21 (4.39\%) in \textbf{Paris-13}.
        Most buildings are affected by the \texttt{Building Errors} family ($>$ 58.16\%) and the \texttt{Facet Errors} one ($>$ 75.94\%).\\

        At the \texttt{finesse} level 3, two axes of analysis are possible.
        First, we group errors that are very frequent in the dataset.
        Over-segmentation errors (\texttt{FOS} and \texttt{BOS}), in both error families, are well represented ranging from 38.9\% up to 66.8\%.
        The same is true for \texttt{FIG} (59.8-80\%).
        \texttt{FIT}, on the other hand, are very rare in all the areas with ratios a little less than 1.5\%.
        The rest have a presence ratio within the percentage interval of [10, 30].
        The errors that are rare are understandably going to impact negatively the learning process.\\
        
        Second, we can compare error frequency discrepancies depending on the studied scene.
        \textbf{Elancourt} is different compared to the relatively close sets \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Paris-13}, with regards to \texttt{BOS}, \texttt{BUS} and \texttt{BIT}.
        In fact, the last two areas are more densely urbanized than the first one exhibitting the same properties at \gls{acr::lod}-0.
        \texttt{BIB}, on the other hand, are equally distributed over the different datasets as it depends mostly on the input sensor data resolution independently of building types.\\
        At the facet level, \texttt{FIT} is also equally occuring across all the scenes different from the rest of \texttt{Facet errors}.
        In fact, \texttt{FOS} occurence ratio is related to the size of facets in urban scenes.
        Actually, the less complex roof structures are, the more big are facets and the more chance they have to be over segmented.
        Indeed, \textbf{Elancourt}, \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Paris-13} scenes are ordered in an ascending manner of their roof structure complexity.
        Conversely, in line with the previous analysis, \texttt{FUS} are less present in \textbf{Elancourt} than in \textbf{Nantes} which, in turn, contains less of the same error than \textbf{Paris-13}.
        \texttt{FIB} is distributed in the same manner as \texttt{FUS}.
        This is mainly due to the fact that the more a roof structure is complex the more precision errors are possible.
        \texttt{FIG} does not keep the same dynamic as its frequency keeps stable from \textbf{Elancourt} and \textbf{Nantes} but jumps considerably in \textbf{Paris-13}.
        This may be explained by the fact that the gap in \texttt{FUS} error ratios between \textbf{Paris-13} and \textbf{Nantes} is more important than that of \texttt{FOS} errors, contrarily to the same gaps for the same errors between \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Elancourt} which compensate each other.

\section{\textsc{Pipeline evaluation}}
    \label{sec::experiments::evaluation}

    \subsection{\textsc{Experimental set-up}}
        \label{subsec::experiments::evaluation::setup}

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Feature configuration}}
            \label{subsubsec::experiments::evaluation::setup::feature_configurations}
            \paragraph{Baseline features}
                The geometric features are always available.
                As a consequence, we tested four feature configurations: ``geometric features'' (\textbf{Geom.}) only, ``geometric and height features''(\textbf{Geom.} $\cup$ \textbf{Hei.}), ``geometric and image features''(\textbf{Geom.} $\cup$ \textbf{Im.}) as well as ``geometric, height and image features''(\textbf{All.}).
                In order to have a better compare the important of each modality, the feature vectors they produce are of the same size.
                Actually, using the function \(S_{\text{manual}}\) defined in Equation~\ref{eq::statistical_extractor}, the geometric feature vector in Equation~\ref{eq::geometric_features} is of dimension
                \begin{equation*}
                    \underbrace{4}_{\substack{\text{the output dimension}\\\text{of the function } S_{\text{manual}} }} \times \underbrace{5}_{\substack{\text{the number of the facet}\\\text{graph attributes}}} = 20.
                \end{equation*}
                Regarding height based feature vectors their dimension depend on the histogram parameters.
                Since we compute differences between observed and model height at terrain level also (\textit{cf.} Subsection~\ref{subsec::learned_evaluation::baseline::height}), and because these are virtually unbounded and can differ from one scene to another, the maximum possible discrepancy is limited to \SI{\pm 50}{\m} for all scenes.
                In order to have the same feature vector dimension for this modality, the number of bins is fixed manually to \(20\).
                For image based features, the cosine similarity between normal vectors, used in Equation~\ref{eq::corr_fac}, is by definition bounded in the interval [-1, 1].
                This interval is consequently divided evenly into \(20\) bins for the histogram computation.
                The \glspl{acr::dsm} and orthorectified images used to derive height and image features have the same spatial resolution as the reconstruction input data.\\

            \paragraph{Richer features}

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Considered labels}}
            All \textbf{\gls{acr::efin}} levels were tested.
            The input models are generalized to \gls{acr::lod}-2.
            As a consequence, we chose \textbf{\gls{acr::elod}} = \gls{acr::lod}-2.
            If the \textbf{exclusivity} is \textsc{on}, at \textbf{\gls{acr::efin}} level 3, the second stage classification results depends on the first one.
            We are, at this stage, trying to prove the feasability, in the first place, of the proposed approach.
            As proven in the latter experiments (\textit{cf.} Section~\ref{sec::more_experiments::finesse}), the first stage results are not good enough to test this configuration.
            That is why we limited the experiments to the case where the \textbf{exclusivity} is set to be \textsc{off}.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Classification settings}}

            \paragraph{Classifiers}
                As discussed in , two 
                \subparagraph{Random Forest}
                    1,000
                    4
                    Kernel PCA
                    20: same dimensions
                    50: better results?

                \subparagraph{\acrshort*{acr::svm}}
                    Kernels for graphs are up
                    Kernels for feature vectors : rbf gamma .001 to not over fit
                    C 10 not to overpenalize

            \paragraph{Used metrics}
                The overall accuracy is not interesting due to the highly unbalanced label distribution.
                We prefer reporting recall ($Rec$) and precision ($Prec$) ratios.
                As a reminder these metrics are defined as follows:
                \begin{align}
                    \label{eq::recall_precision}
                    \bm{Rec} &\triangleq \frac{tp}{tp + fp}\\
                    \bm{Prec} &\triangleq \frac{tp}{tp + fn},
                \end{align}
                where:
                \begin{conditions}
                    tp & the number of instances predicted positive that are positive in reality;\\
                    fp & the number of instances predicted positive that are negative in reality;\\
                    fn & the number of instances predicted negative that are positive in reality.
                \end{conditions}
                Recall expresses, from a number of samples of a given class, the proportion that was rightfully detected as such.
                Precision indicates how much samples, amongst the detected ones, were, in truth, part of the studied class~\parencite{powers2011evaluation}.
                We also summarize these two ratios with their harmonic mean, the F-score:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::f_score}
                    F_{score} \triangleq \frac{2}{\frac{1}{Rec} + \frac{1}{Prec}}.
                \end{equation}
                Unless said otherwise, all experiments were conducted performing a 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting/underfitting issues.
                Only test results are reported.

    \subsection{\textsc{Baseline feature analysis}}
        \label{subsec::experiments::evaluation::baseline_feature_analysis}
        At this stage, we study only the baseline features proposed in Section~\ref{sec::learned_evaluation::baseline}.
        The goal is to assess the added value of each modality.
        First, the \gls{acr::rmse} is proven to be inadequate for detecting errors in our taxonomy.
        Second, prediction results from all possible feature configurations are compared in Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec::experiments::evaluation::setup::feature_configurations}.
        Third and last, we conclude the analysis by studying the feature importance, for all training zones.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{\acrshort*{acr::rmse} predictive capacity}}
            \label{subsubsec::experiments::evaluation::baseline_feature_analysis::rmse}
            The \gls{acr::rmse} is the standard measure in most of \gls{acr::3d} reconstruction methods.
            As a consequence, we use it herein as a reference that our baseline is to be compared to.
            We train the classifier on Elancourt with the one dimensional feature vector containing the \gls{acr::rmse}.
            This scene was sufficient enough for our analysis.
            Mean test results are shown in Table~\ref{tab::rmse_results}.\\

            We can distinguish two groups of errors: 
            \begin{description}
                \item[\texttt{BOS}, \texttt{FOS} and \texttt{FIG}:] These have a high recall and a low precision and overall accuracy;
                \item[\texttt{BUS}, \texttt{BIB}, \texttt{BIT}, \texttt{FUS}, \texttt{FIB} and \texttt{FIT}:] These have low recall and precision ratios.
            \end{description}
            The first (\textit{resp.} second) group coincides exactly with errors that affect more (\textit{resp.} less) than half of the buildings.
            For this kind of errors, the classifier assigns to almost all samples the positive class.
            In fact, we end up with a high ratio of false positives (false alarms) and hence a high recall ratio that is coupled with a weak precision and overall accuracy.
            Exactly the inverse happens with the rest of the errors as we obtain a high percentage of false negative.
            We can safely conclude that the \gls{acr::rmse} is not able to detect errors defined in our taxonomy.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Feature ablation study}}
            \label{subsubsec::experiments::evaluation::baseline_feature_analysis::ablation}
            We tested the different feature configurations, at \texttt{finesse} level 3 and in all urban zones.
            Mean precision and recall test results are reported in Table~\ref{tab::ablation_f3}.
            F-scores are averaged across all feature configurations and represented in Figure~\ref{fig::f_score_ablation_f3}.\\

            First, we can point out that fact that geometric features alone are generally sufficient.
            It is actually the best alternative for topological error detection as shown for \texttt{BOS}, \texttt{FOS}, \texttt{FUS}, \texttt{FIT} and \texttt{BIT} in Table~\ref{tab::ablation_f3}.
            This is confirmed also by the low variance observed in Subfigure~\ref{subfig::f_score_f3_building}.
            An exception is noticed with \texttt{BUS} in \textbf{Elancourt}, where height-based features allow an increase of around 9\% in recall without, practically, any loss in precision.
            Similar behaviour is noticed for \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Paris-13} with image-based features (+20\% in recall).
            The first case can be explained by the discrepancy in height that can be observed between under-segmented buildings.
            The second is made clear by the difference in roof colors, in dense uniform settings (Figure~\ref{fig::bul_err}.a).
            This helps identifying different instances of buildings.\\

            Figure~\ref{fig::f_score_ablation_f3} shows that all \texttt{Building errors} labels are better detected in \textbf{Elancourt}.
            It is also the case of \texttt{FOS} and \texttt{FIT}.
            A certain monotony can be noticed, at the exception of \texttt{BOS}.
            Better resultas are obtained for \textbf{Paris-13} than for \textbf{Nantes}, while having around half the number of models to train on.
            This means that \texttt{BOS} cannot be easily learnt in \textbf{Nantes}.
            It is coherent with the fact that the dataset represents a part of the dense downtown of the city.
            The same monotony is observed, this time in reverse, with the rest of \texttt{Facet errors} defects. \textbf{Paris-13} is much better with less training samples.
            For geometric defects (\texttt{FIG} and \texttt{FIB}), \textbf{Nantes} is comparable to \textbf{Paris-13}, but, with \texttt{FUS}, it is way much worse.
            This may result from the highly heterogeneous aspect of this dataset that encompasses high tower buildings with a densely populated city district.
            Finally, well represented errors are more easily detected than the less frequent ones, especially the rare ones like \texttt{FIT} in \textbf{Nantes} and \textbf{Paris-13}.
        
        \subsubsection{\textsc{Feature importance}}
            \label{subsubsec::experiments::evaluation::baseline_feature_analysis::feature_importance}
            Random forest classifiers can easily infer feature importances at training time.
            These were here computed and aggregated by modality in all urban scenes (\textit{cf.} Figure~\ref{fig::feature_importances}).\\

            At first, we observe how much individual attributes are important before being gathered.
            For geometric features, all attributes are equally important.
            However, concerning image and height-based features, only a few are relevant (higher feature importance ratio).
            Indeed, these few attributes correspond to the highest and lowest values of the histograms.
            As described earlier, image and height features consist of a histogram of distances between the model and the real measured signals:
            vector cosine similarity, for the first, and the \(L_2\) norm for the last.
            It is clear that the presence of errors would result in saturating the high values in the histogram, while an absence of defects would imply a big number of low values.
            This intuitively explains the observed phenomenon.
            
            In a second time, we notice that no modality is more important than the others, contrarily to what was observed in Table~\ref{tab::ablation_f3}.
            In fact, for most atomic errors, test results using geometric features are comparable to those obtained with more modalities.
            However, during training, all modalities are relevant ($\sim$1/3 in Figure~\ref{fig::feature_importances}).
            This explains why all configurations are kept for subsequent analysis.
