Presented herein is a detailed tour of the different notions necessary for the understanding of the present manuscript.
It is divided into three sections.
First, we categories, in section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling}, the building \gls{acr::3d} modeling techniques.
A global idea of the subject is required to have a good idea of what defects to expect in evaluated building models.
Second, we present a complete state-of-the-art survey on quality evaluation for \gls{acr::3d} building models (\textit{cf}. section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::quality}).
In the last section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::mlpr}, are presented the main tools that are used in our proposed approach.
Indeed, we discuss aspects of supervised classification as well as some feature extraction techniques.

\section{\textsc{Building \texorpdfstring{\gls*{acr::3d}}{3D} modeling}}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling}
    The goal of this section is to present a general prespective on \gls{acr::3d} modeling techniques.
    This is not in any case a complete survey of this field.
    We refer the reader to a comprehensive study of metods used in urban reconstruction by~\textcite{musialski2013survey}.\\
    Herein, we classify the building modeling approaches based on different criteria.
    In section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::input}, we discuss the different types of input data fed to modeling pipelines.
    Next, in section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::automation}, is presented the different levels of automation in proposed \gls{acr::3d} modeling, while in section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::strategy}, are discussed the different modeling strategies.
    We finish by mentioning the differences between outdoor and indoor modeling in section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::in_out_door}, as well as the scalability of the different techniques.

\section{\textsc{Quality evaluation of \texorpdfstring{\gls*{acr::3d}}{3D} building models}}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::quality}
    We have seen previously the various methods used to automatically model buildings.
    The goal of this section is to describe the available approaches that evaluate the quality of such models.
    These could be distinguished based on two criteria.\\
    In subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}, are presented the quality evaluation methods based on their output.
    An alternative perspective to charecterize quality evaluation methods relies upon the type of reference data (\textit{cf.} subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}).
    Based on this survey, we state in details, in subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::novelty}, how the work presented in this thesis is different from what was already proposed in the literature. 

    \subsection{\textsc{Output types}}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}
        We distinguish herein quality evaluation methods based on the kind of output they produce.
        Fidelity metrics is a first instance of output types.
        The second is semantic labels.
        In what follows, we explain, in details, these differences between the two method types.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Fidelity metrics based methods}}
            One way to characterize the quality of a building model is to compute indices or metrics reporting its accuracy.\\

            Most metrics provide information on the geometric precision of the model.
            These are computed for different geometric objects.
            Below, depending on the geometric dimension of the latter, we categorize the geometric fidelity metrics.\\

            We start with zero dimensional objects: \textit{i.e.} points.
            In this case, metrics are based on their coordinates.
            The goal is to detect positional inaccuraccies~\parencite{kaartinen2005accuracy}.
            In constrast, the choice of points to be inspected is not simple.
            Corner points resulting from the intersection of edges in the model is one choice.
            In fact,~\textcite{zeng2014multicriteria} registers corner points from the evaluated model and the corresponding reference.
            Based on this registration, a comparison is drawn using \gls{acr::rmse}, just as in~\parencite{landes2012quality} and~\parencite{you2011quality}.
            The same points are used as a proxy for manual quality inspection by~\textcite{elberink2011quality}.
            Another alternative is to sample points from lines or surfaces to be compared.
            These could be predetermined manually as in~\textcite{kaartinen2005accuracy} or sampled regularely as demonstrated by~\textcite{vogtle2003quality} or by~\textcite{tran2019geometric}.
            Imprecisions are not computed only relying the \gls{acr::rmse}, but can also be separated into planimetric and height inaccuraccies~\parencite{vogtle2003quality, kaartinen2005accuracy, jaynes2003recognition}.\\

            Second comes edges and all one dimensional objects in general.
            These convey structural, in addition to positional, informations.
            \textcite{kaartinen2005accuracy} compares lengths as well as slopes of edges formed by reference points.
            Edges related metrics are also used as an intermediary as shown by~\textcite{elberink2011quality} and~\textcite{michelin2013quality}.
            They are both interested in edges resulting from facet intersections.
            While the first relies on \gls{acr::rmse}, the second computes more complex metrics that compares model edges to ones extracted out of sensor data.\\

            Next are compared surfaces (\textit{i.e.} two dimensional objects), bounded (for example, polygons) or not (like planes).
            These hold more structural information than the first ones and hence are widely used for evaluation.
            \textcite{rottensteiner2014results} used height discrepency of roof planes so as to evaluate building models.
            This ideal for Manhattan-world assumptions as was the case of~\textcite{zebedin2008fusion}.
            In addition to height discrepency, normal displacement is computed using always the same \gls{acr::rmse} metric by~\textcite{henricsson19973}.
            Conversely,~\textcite{zeng2014multicriteria} uses also a \gls{acr::rmse} for comparison, but not in the Euclidean space.
            In fact, after mapping the evaluated and reference models to a sphere, they compare their spherical harmonic~\parencite{brechbuhler1995parametrization} representations.
            Just as with edges, planes can be evaluated using angular measurements, as was proposed by~\textcite{landes2012quality} and~\textcite{henricsson19973}.
            Another alternative is to compare reconstructed and reference models based on surface area comparisons.
            These are mostly based on ratios like completeness and correctness\footnote{in other words, recall and precision respectively.}~\parencite{rottensteiner2014results,landes2012quality,henricsson19973,schuster2003new}.\\

            Last, are three dimensional (\textit{i.e.} volume) evaluation.
            The same detection ratios that were computed for surfaces are again calculated to evaluate volumes this times, as shown by~\textcite{mohamed2013quality, zeng2014multicriteria,jaynes2003recognition,nguatem2017modeling}.
            These are the only metrics used for volumes that we are aware of.\\

            Regarding \textit{implicit} semantics, as far as we are aware, only one metric is widely used to evaluate its impact.
            As discussed previously in subsection~\ref{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::building_3d_modeling}, compaction is one byproduct of semantics.
            As a consequence, it was used as an index to evaluate reconstructions\footnote{It is sometimes called by its antonym: complexity.}: the more a model was compact the better it was.
            This is reflected, for instance, in the work of~\textcite{lafarge2012creating},~\textcite{zhang2017deep},~\textcite{duan_eccv16},~\textcite{zeng2018neural} and~\textcite{zhu2018large}, where this metric is never used alone but always alongside geometric ones.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Semantic labels based methods}}
            \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output::semantic}
            In a drive to provide a quantitative assessment of building models, the previously defined metrics fail to convey specific and localized information about a predetermined building model.
            These indices are usually used to give a general idea of the quality of models produced by some modeling method.
            Moreover, they do not usually carry semantics, which is critical for further processing steps such as manual correction~\parencite{elberink2011quality}.
            Some evaluation methods, in an effort to alleviate these issues, yield semantic labels that describe the errors of an evaluated model.
            Hereafter, are described the different types of labels that were proposed in the literature.\\

            \parencite{boudet2006supervised} was the first ever work, that we are aware of, which tackles semantic labels as outputs of the evaluation .
            This approach has four classes which indicate how much valid can the modeling be: ``acceptable'' and ``correct'' portray valid buildings while ``false"``and ``generalized"``are refused.
            It can be seen as a four grade based score system expressing the confidence in a building model.
            The main limitation of this method is the fact that the proposed labels do not specify what defects a model presents if it is not valid.
            It is, therefore, hard to use for model correction.
            Besides, the acceptable defect definitions depend also on each use case.
            For instance, a comunications company would be more adament on the accuracy of roof parts, which would affect wave propagation, rather than an insurance company interested in flood damage estimation.
            This means that each use case implies a relabeling that could be potentially different from other one.\\
            
            The first hints of a fine grained semantic labeling of building model errors lay in the work of~\textcite{rottensteiner2014results}.
            This work was the first to report segmentation issues, at facet level, in labels instead of a global ratio.
            They distinguish between oversegmentation cases, undersegmentation cases and cases where both co-occur.\\

            On the other hand, these mentioned errors are not comprehensive: they do not cover all possible building model errors.
            \textcite{michelin2013quality} came up with a richer taxonomy of errors that are categorized into three big families:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Footprint errors: these portray errors relative to the building footprint, which is used by many modeling algorithms as input.
                        Errors contained in this family are: ``erroneous outline'', ``unexisting building'', ``missing inner court'' and ``inaccurate footprint''.
                \item Reconstruction errors: these are caused by the modeling approach.
                        These defects can be the result of the incompatibility of some \textit{a priori} hypotheses about the scene, for instance.
                        Such errors are: ``under-segmentation'', ``over-segmentation'', ``inaccurate roof'' and ``Z translation''.
                \item Vegetation errors: this corresponds to a special case when modeled building are occluded, completely or partially, by higher vegetation.
                        It becomes impossible to evaluate properly these models.
            \end{itemize}
            Although the last taxonomy is rich, it is not exhaustive enough as it misses cases that are not present in the urban zone that was studied in the paper, such as inaccurate primitive choices.
            Moreover, it adopts the point of view of the modeling method that was used to provide their dataset.
            Knowing the specific weaknesses of the latter guided the choice of error family classification and the error definitions.
            This is particularly clear when looking at their error categorization.
            In fact, the first error class relates to the fact that the used building modeling approach~\parencite{durupt2006automatic} relies on footprints given as input.
            The second category corresponds to the actual step of building roof structure inference.

    \subsection{\textsc{Reference data types}}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}
        In order to evaluate models, reference data are utilized for comparison.
        Based on the latter, another way to discriminate among modeling methods is possible.
        The first class of reference data are high quality ground truth building \gls{acr::3d} models.
        Remote sensing data is the second alternative that is used for reference.
        Neither of these two choices do influence the type of output the evaluation method produces.
        Hereafter, is explained the difference between the two categories.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{High resolution ground truth}}
            Ground truth building models are mainly acquired manually.
            Herein, are listed the different ground truth measurement techniques, in descending order of accuracy.\\

            The most obvious case consists in field measurements of the modeled building.
            \textcite{dick2004modelling}, for instance, evaluated their buildings based on manual tape measurements taken on specific architectural features, like windows and columns, with an accuracy of \SI{0.01}{\m} for the first and \SI{0.1}{\m} for the second.
            Complete and scalables measurements of buildings are possible using topographic surveys.
            Using the latter, building models could be reconstructed with precision up to \SI{\pm 0.1}{\m}~\parencite{henricsson19973} or \SI{\pm 0.05}{\m}~\parencite{vogtle2003quality}.\\
            There is also the possibility of manually modeling the building using oblique images, or stereoplotting.
            ~\textcite{zebedin2008fusion} uses such a method to produce their reference data from aerial images with accuracy up to the order of \SI{\pm 0.15}{\m}.
            The same procedure was used also by~\textcite{jaynes2003recognition} producing models with inaccuraccies bounded by \SI{\pm 1/3}{\m}.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Remote sensing data}}
            Reference ground truth models are not easy to come by~\parencite{schuster2003new}.
            The previous choice is hard to scale up to district or city levels.
            In fact, they are more suitable to evaluate few building models: \textit{e.g.} in order to validate a reconstruction method.
            On the other hand, remote sensing data are more accessible and could be used, instead, as reference.
            In fact, since these are usually fed as input in modeling methods, it is only reasonable to evaluate the produced models in comparison to the intake.
            Listed here, are the different types of remote sensing data and how they could be used for building model evaluation.\\

            Aerial images are the first example of reference data used in building model evaluation.
            These could be original oblique images or preprocessed orthoimages.
            The first class of images are the most precise but the other one is more available.
            Oblique images were used by~\textcite{michelin2013quality} to extract \gls{acr::3d} segments based on plane sweeping techniques.
            Reference edges are filtered out and are used to evaluate the \gls{acr::3d} model (intersection) edges.
            Based on these segments,~\textcite{boudet2006supervised} not only evaluates edges but also corners (\textit{i.e.} edge intersections) and planes.
            Facet were also evaluated, in~\parencite{boudet2006supervised}, based on correlation functions computed from multiple overlapping oblique images.
            Orthoimages were used also to, for instance, compute \gls{acr::ndvi} scores for vegetation occluded building model discrimination.\\

            Second, are \gls{acr::lidar} point clouds.
            This type of data have the inherent advantage, compared to images, of natively providing depth information.
            \textcite{kaartinen2005accuracy} used data that was acquired multiple times with a guarantied precision up to \SI{0.083}{\m} in plane and \SI{0.035}{\m} in height.
            Out of the latter were chosen reference points that were compared to equivalents in the evaluated building models (check the previous sub-subsection).
            All the points could also be used for comparison by computing metrics such as \gls{acr::rmse}~\parencite{lafarge2012creating,zhu2018large}.
            Original input data is not always accessible.
            One issue arises when using different data: data registration.
            This is taken into account by~\textcite{akca2010quality}, before addressing the completeness of building models.\\
            
            Third and last, are presented height maps.
            These are not sensor data as they are a byproduct of earlier data types.
            Still, they are considered here since they are used as input by some building modeling pipelines.
            Just like with \gls{acr::lidar}, \gls{acr::dsm} is used for building models comparison based on \gls{acr::rmse}~\parencite{zeng2018neural}.
            \textcite{michelin2013quality}, however, uses the same data but differently.
            In fact, \gls{acr::dsm}, being a result of oblique images, can be used as proxy, to help extracting \gls{acr::3d} geometric features instead of recomputing correlation scores like in~\parencite{boudet2006supervised}.
            It can also be valuable for missing court detection by calculating sky viewshed angle scores~\parencite{michelin2013quality}.

    \subsection{\textsc{Novelty of the proposed method}}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::novelty}
        Based on the subsection~\ref{subsec::introduction::contributions::positioning}, we can understand how most quality evaluation methods are unsuitable for the objectives that where stated.\\

        In fact, the semantic character of the evaluation overrules approaches relying only on geometry based metrics.
        This represents most of the methods discussed earlier (\textit{c.f.} subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}).
        These metrics could be used afterwards one a semantic error is identified as a complement to help quantify the defect.
        On the other hand, the need for reasonably available reference data, which is dictated by the large-scale constraint, implies the reliance on remote sensing data based methods (\textit{c.f.} subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}).\\

        Methods that satisfy both conditions are in the number of two:~\textcite{boudet2006supervised,michelin2013quality}.
        Both define semantic errors that are detected using Oblique images and \glspl{acr::dsm}.
        A classifier learns statistical properties of the building \gls{acr::3d} models using features that are derived from these sensor data.
        The learning process further helps scaling the process to unseen data by predicting errors using the same attributes.\\

        Our work relies on the same idea, but goes a bit farther by proposing the possibility to evaluate building models without using any reference data.
        It also offers a new taxonomy of errors that is intended to be exhaustive and generalizable.
        The last idea will be developped in details in chapter~\ref{chap::semantic_evaluation}, while chapter~\ref{chap::learned_evaluation} presents how features are chosen to represent building models and the learning process.

\section{\textsc{Supervised learning and pattern recognition}}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::mlpr}
    In this section are presented notions from statistic learning and computer vision domains that were usefull for this work.
    This constitutes a simple reminder and is not a thorough survey of the field.
    Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers} start off with a brief description of utilized supervised classifiers in .
    Second (section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction}) comes a presentation of computer vision concepts on which our method is based.
    Last is discussed graph classification that was also instrumental in this work.

    \subsection{\textsc{Supervised classifiers}}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers}
        In this subsection, we denote a family of observations and their classes by $\left((\bm{x^i}, y^i)\right)_{i=1,2,\dots,n}$.
        Features are in practice finite dimensional vectors: \textit{i.e.} $\forall i=1,2,\dots,n \;, \bm{x^i} \in \mathbb{R}^d$.
        Classes are modeled by a finite set bijective to the set $\forall i=1,2,\dots,n \;, y_i \in \{1,2,\dots,C\}$.
        The goal of supervised classification is to learn, based on the training set $\left((\bm{x^i}, y^i)\right)_{i=1,2,\dots,n}$, some statistical characteristics in order to predict the classes of new observations $\left(\bm{x^i}\right)_{i=1,2,\dots,n'}$\footnote{This is called the test set.}.
        This type of problems is said to be multi-class: each instance has one possible class out of a number of possibilities.
        In the special case of binary classification, only two classes are possible $\forall i=1,2,\dots,n \;,\allowbreak y^i \in \{0, 1\}$.\\
        
        On another hand, the multi-label classification problem is the case where to each instance corresponds a number $L$ of binary labels: \textit{i.e.} $\forall i=1,2,\dots,n \;, y^i = (y^i_1, y^i_2, \dots, y^i_L) \in \{0, 1\}^L$.
        In this case, associating features with each label $\forall i=1,2,\dots,n \;, y^i_l$ can be seen as an independent binary classification problem.
        This is different from multi-class problems, as for the latter only one class is possible while in the other multiple labels can be detected.\\

        Hereafter, are presented two supervised classifiers: the \gls{acr::svm} algorithm and Random Forests, both of which are used in this work.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{\acrlong*{acr::svm}}}
            \glspl{acr::svm} are a special type of linear classifiers.
            The initial classes $\left(y^k\right)_{k=1, 2, \dots, n}$ are transformed into $\left(\tilde{y}^k\right)_{k=1, 2, \dots, n}$, using the map: $y \mapsto \tilde{y} = 2\cdot y - 1$.
            There are always two possible classes $\{1, -1\}$.
            This simple transformation is use so as to simplify the latter equations.

            We remind the reader of the decision function\footnote{A decision function assigns a class to given observation.} of a linear classifier:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq::linear}
                \begin{aligned}
                    \mathbf{D}_{\text{linear}, \bm{w}, b}: \mathbb{R}^d &\rightarrow \{-1, 1\}\\
                    \bm{x} &\mapsto 2 \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\bm{w}^\intercal \cdot \bm{x} + b\geq 0} - 1 \quad.
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}
            where:
            \begin{conditions}
                \bm{w} & is the weight vector;\\
                b & is the bias.
            \end{conditions}

            \paragraph{Hard margin}
                In order to understand the idea behind the \gls{acr::svm} classifier, we start by assuming that the dataset to be classified $\left((\bm{x}^k, y^k)\right)_{k=1, 2, \dots, n}$ is linearly separable.
                It means that there is at least one hyperplane $(H_0)$ that can separate perfectly the two classes.
                We can order points of class based on their distance to the hyperplane $(H_0)$: $\bm{x} \mapsto d(\bm{x}, H_0)$.
                The closest positive (\textit{resp.} negative) points (\textit{i.e.} of class $1$ (\textit{resp.}  $-1$)) to $(H_0)$ are called positive (\textit{resp.} negative) support vectors.
                Support hyperplanes are the hyperplanes that are parallel to the separator and passes through the support vectors.
                This can be summarized as:
                \begin{eqnarray}
                    \{\bm{x}^+_s: s = 1, 2, \dots, n_{psp}\} &\triangleq \arg\min\{d(\bm{x}_k, H_0) : k=1, 2, \dots, n \wedge \tilde{y}^k = 1\}\\
                    \{\bm{x}^-_s: s = 1, 2, \dots, n_{nsp}\} &\triangleq \arg\min\{d(\bm{x}_k, H_0) : k=1, 2, \dots, n \wedge \tilde{y}^k = -1\}

                where:
                \begin{conditions}

                    n_{nsp} & is the number of negative support vectors.\\
                \end{conditions}

                We define:
                \begin{equation*}
                    Sol \triangleq \{\omega \in \mathbb{R}^d : \omega.\bm{x} + b = 0\}.
                \end{equation*}
                We verify that:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\} \quad (\bm{w}, b) \in  Sol \Rightarrow (\lambda . \bm{w}, \lambda.b) \in Sol.
                \end{equation*}
                In other words, the solution $(\bm{w}^*, b^*)$ is unique up to multiplicatif term $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$.
                In this context, $(\bm{w}, b)$ is chosen so that the support hyperplanes verify:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::support_lines}
                    \begin{cases}

                        \forall s=1,2,\dots,n_{nsp} \quad \bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^-_s + b = -1                
                    \end{cases}
                \end{equation}

                        \label{fig::linear_separable} A hyperplane separator in $\mathbb{R}^2$ corresponds to a line.
                        In this case, $n_{psp} = n_{nsp} = 1$.

                    }
                \end{figure}

                Figure~\ref{fig::linear_separable} illustrates these notions.
                The uncertainty of a point classification is an increasing function of the distance of that point to the separator.
                In the hard margin case, the given samples are supposed to be certain.
                Since support vectors are the closest certain points to $(H_0)$, the class of points $\bm{p}$ that verify $\vert\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{p} + b\vert \geq 1$ is known with probability $1$.
                Conversely, the points that lay between the support hyperplanes are the most uncertain.
                The bigger the distance between these two lines the more nuanced the classifier decision is.
                The main idea behind \glspl{acr::svm} is to maximize this distance.
                The latter is called margin and denoted $M$.\\

                In order to compute the margin, we can interpret it as the length of the orthogonal projection of any vector $\bm{v}_{st}$\footnote{$\forall (s, t) \in \{1,2,\dots,n_{nsp}\} \times \{1,2,\dots,n_{psp}\}$} going from a negative support vector $\bm{x}^-_s$ to a positive one $\bm{x}^+_t$ on any line carried by $\bm{w}$.
                Since all support vectors of the same class lay on the same line, the choice of $(s,t)$ is inconsequential.
                We can hence deduce:
                \begin{align}
                    M &= \frac{\bm{w}^\intercal}{\Vert\bm{w}\Vert} \cdot (\bm{x}^+_1 - \bm{x}^-_1) \nonumber \\
                    M &= \frac{2}{\Vert\bm{w}\Vert}
                \end{align}

                Maximizing $M$ is actually equivalent to minimizing $\Vert\bm{w}\Vert$.
                In the purpose of simplifying the resolution of the problem, we drop the square root and minimize instead $\Vert\bm{w}\Vert^2$.
                The certainty in the given samples is translated by the inequalities:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \begin{cases}
                        \bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b \geq 1 & \forall i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n: \tilde{y}^i = 1\}\\
                        \bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b \leq -1 & \forall i \in \{1, 2, \dots, n: \tilde{y}^i = -1\}
                    \end{cases}.
                \end{equation*}
                These can be summed in one, as follows:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::hard_margin}
                    \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b) \geq 1 \; \forall i = 1, 2, \dots, n.
                \end{equation}
                Thus, the \gls{acr::svm} problem can be formalized as a convex constrained quadratic optimization one:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::hard_svm_primal}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & \min_{\bm{w}}
                        & & {\Vert \bm{w} \Vert}^2 \\
                        & \text{s.t.}
                        & & \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b) \geq 1 \; \forall i = 1, 2, \dots, n
                    \end{aligned}.
                \end{equation}

            \paragraph{Soft margin}
                In the previous case, we assumed that we are always certain about the classes of the given samples.
                The margin cannot contain any of those points.
                This explains the name hard margin.
                We are always guaranteed to have a solution of a hard margin \gls{acr::svm} in the case of linear separability.
                however, if the last condition is not met, there is no such solution.
                To alleviate this problem, we allow some uncertainty in the given samples in order to fit the linear model.\\

                \begin{figure}
                    \centering
                    \includestandalone[mode=buildnew, width=\textwidth]{figures/svm/non_linear_separable}

                        The orange lines (\textit{resp.} green line) correspond to the support hyperplanes (\textit{resp.} separator).
                        Dataset points are allowed to be inside the margin and even in the other side of the separator.

                    }
                \end{figure}

                To put this into mathematical terms, we start by the reminding the constraint of the hard margin problem in Equation~\ref{eq::hard_margin}.
                Allowing uncertainty for some given point $\bm{x}^i$ comes back to allowing it to be in the wrong side of the support hyperplane: \textit{i.e.} $\tilde{y}^l.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^l + b) < 1$.
                In this case, we define: $\xi^i := 1 - \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b) > 0$.
                Otherwise, $\xi^i := 0$.
                These defined values are called slack variables.
                They express how much each point is uncertain.
                They can be expressed in a compressed form called hinge loss:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::slack_variables}
                    \xi^i \triangleq \max\left(1 - \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b), 0\right).
                \end{equation}
                The soft margin constraint translates now to:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::soft_margin}
                    \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b) \geq 1 - \xi^i.
                \end{equation}
                Four cases are distinguished, for slack variables:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $\xi^i = 0$: the class of the point is certain;
                    \item $0 < \xi^i \leq 1$: the point is of the same class but is uncertain: \textit{i.e.} between the support hyperplane and the separator;
                    \item $1 < \xi^i < 2$: the point is of the opposite class and is uncertain: \textit{i.e.} between the separator and the opposite support hyperplane;
                    \item $2 \leq \xi^i$: the point is certainly of the opposite class: \textit{i.e.} beyond the opposite support hyperplane.
                \end{itemize}
                As a consequence, when a dataset is not linearly separable, at least one sample $i_0$ cannot fit in a linear model and $1 < \xi^{i_0}$.
                All these situations are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig::soft_margin}.\\

                The idea is to find a configuration where most slack variables are null or near $0$.
                Sparsity is also wished: we prefer having one wrong point rather than a lot of points that are uncertain.
                For this purpose, these variables would be penalized against using an $L_1$ norm.
                Since all slack variables are positive, the soft margin \gls{acr::svm} problem becomes:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::soft_svm_primal}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & \min_{\bm{w} \in \mathbb{R}^d}
                        & & {\Vert \bm{w} \Vert}^2 + C \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n \xi^i \\
                        & \text{s.t.} & & \tilde{y}^i.(\bm{w}^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^i + b) \geq 1, \; \forall i = 1, 2, \dots, n\\
                        & & & \xi^i \geq 0, \; \forall i = 1, 2, \dots, n
                    \end{aligned}.
                \end{equation}
                where:
                \begin{conditions}
                    C & is the penalization constant.\\
                \end{conditions}

                A small $C$ means the slack variables are allowed to get big: the margin is expected to be big.
                A high $C$ leads to a tight margin as it penalizes any uncertainty.
                The special case where $C=\infty$ corresponds simply to the hard margin case.
                Hence, the penalization constant is tuned, using cross-validation for instance, so as to achieve the best generalization power.

                Since the problem stated in Equation~\ref{eq::soft_svm_primal} is a convex optimization problem, solving it is equivalent to solving the dual:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::soft_svm_dual}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & \max_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{R}_+}
                        & & \sum_{1\leq i \leq n} \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{1\leq l \leq n\\1\leq p \leq n}}\alpha_l\cdot\alpha_p\cdot\tilde{y}^l\cdot\tilde{y}^p\cdot(\bm{x}^l)^\intercal\cdot\bm{x}^p\\
                        &\text{s.t.} & & \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n}\tilde{y}^i\cdot\alpha_i=0 \\
                        & & & 0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C \;\forall i=1,2,\dots,n
                        \end{aligned}
                \end{equation}
                A fast solution of this problem is possible using the \gls{acr::smo} developped by~\textcite{platt1998sequential}.
                This will not be detailed herein. 

            \paragraph{Kernel \acrshort*{acr::svm}}
                Not all classification problems can be solved in a linear manner.
                Unfortunately, \gls{acr::svm} is inherently linear.
                However, there is a way to generalize this classifier.\\

                The original feature space where the data is represented is not always an ideal\footnote{An ideal space is one where distances between points are meaningful} one.
                A solution is to find a transformation $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathscr{H}$ that maps initial feature vectors into a Hilbert space $(\mathscr{H}, \langle\cdot{,}\cdot\rangle_{\mathscr{H}})$ where distances between instances are meaningful.
                There is no unique map that satisfy this type of properties.
                We are particularly intersted in a map which transforms the data into a space where they are hopefully linearly separable.
                This illustrated in Figure\ref{fig::circles_transformation}.
                Using a polar coordinate transformation 
                \begin{align*}
                    \Phi: \mathbb{R}^2 &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2 \\
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        x \\
                        y
                    \end{bmatrix} &\mapsto \begin{bmatrix}
                        \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\
                        \text{arctan}_2(y, x)
                    \end{bmatrix},
                \end{align*}
                the dataset can be linearly separable.
                In this particular case, the original probability distribution is known as it was generated manually.
                Moreover, the map codomain is a vector space of the same dimension as the map domain.
                This is usually not the case: in practice, the right mapping is difficult to come by\footnote{If it exists at all.} and the codomain is usually of a higher dimension possibly infinite.
                Finding such a map involves usually heavy compuations.
                However, as we are interested in distances between dataset points, there is an easier way around.
                Using the ``kernel trick'', one can compute any distance in the target space $\mathscr{H}$ using only the scalar product:
                \begin{align}
                    \label{fig::kernel_definition}
                    k: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\\
                    (\bm{x}, \bm{y}) &\mapsto \langle\Phi(\bm{x}), \Phi(\bm{y})\rangle_{\mathscr{H}} \nonumber.
                \end{align}
                Going back to the dual optimization problem stated in Equation~\ref{eq::soft_svm_dual}, we see that only the scalar product between samples is needed.
                Assuming the existence of an adequate mapping $\Phi$, and if we substitute each point by its representation in the new space, we can rewrite, so called, kernel \gls{acr::svm}.
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::kernel_soft_svm_dual}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        & \max_{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n \in \mathbb{R}_+}
                        & & \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n} \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sum_{\substack{1\leq l \geq n\\1\leq p \geq n}}\alpha_l\cdot\alpha_p\cdot\tilde{y}^l\cdot\tilde{y}^p\cdot k(\bm{x}^l, \bm{x}^p)\\
                        &\text{s.t.} & & \sum_{1 \leq i \leq n}\tilde{y}^i\cdot\alpha_i=0 \\
                        & & & 0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C \; \forall i=1,2,\dots,n
                        \end{aligned}
                \end{equation}

                There are more theoretical details for kernels which are not discussed herein.

                    The choice of kernels is not easy.
                    Practitioners experiment with different kernel types and parameters.
                    One can engineer a kernel specific for their application.
                    However, in general, there are some usual kernel that are chosen:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item the native linear kernel:
                        \begin{equation}
                            \label{eq::linear_kernel}
                            k(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \bm{x}^\intercal \cdot \bm{y};
                        \end{equation}
                        \item the \gls{acr::rbf} kernel: for some parameter $(\gamma) \in \mathbb{R}$
                        \begin{equation}
                            \label{eq::rbf_kernel}
                            k_{\gamma}(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \exp{-\gamma \cdot \Vert \bm{x} - \bm{y} \Vert^2};
                        \end{equation}
                        \item the polynomial kernel: for some parameters $(c, d) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\} $
                        \begin{equation}
                            \label{eq::polynomial_kernel}
                            k_{\gamma, c}(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = (\bm{x}^\intercal \cdot \bm{y} + c)^d;
                        \end{equation}
                        \item the sigmoid kernel: for some parameters $(\gamma, c) \in \mathbb{R}^2$
                        \begin{equation}
                            \label{eq::sigmoid_kernel}
                            k_{\gamma, c}(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \gamma \cdot \tanh(\bm{x}^\intercal \cdot \bm{y} + c).
                        \end{equation}
                    \end{itemize}
                    The choice of kernel parameters in important not only for achieving good classification results but also to avoid overfitting problems.

                \subparagraph{\acrlong*{acr::mkl}}
                    Some operations over kernels always yield valid kernels.
                    This is true for instance for summation.
                    In fact, fixing the number of kernels $K\in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\}$, for basis kernels $k_i \; \forall i=1,2,\dots,K$ weithed by $\mu_i \in \mathbb{R}_+\; \forall i=1,2,\dots,K$,
                    \begin{equation*}
                        k(\bm{x}, \bm{y}) = \sum_{i=1}^K \mu_i \cdot k_i(\bm{x}, \bm{y})
                    \end{equation*}
                    is also a valid kernel.
                    Such kernels proved to be better in practice than using single kernels~\parencite{lanckriet2004statistical}.
                    To simplify the problem, the solution is chosen in the simplex of the basis kernels: \textit{i.e.} $ (\mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_K) \in (\mathbb{R}_+)^K  \; s.t. \sum_{i=1}^K \mu_i = 1$.
                    Multiple schemes were presented in order to solve the \gls{acr::mkl} \gls{acr::svm} problem~\parencite{rakotomamonjy2008simplemkl, sun2010multiple, varma2009more}.
                    
            \paragraph{Properties}
                Herein are presented properties of the \gls{acr::svm} classifier based on a practical point of view.
                We start by stating some of its advantages:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Mathematically guaranteed solution: the convex formulation of the problem implies the existence of a global optimum that can be computed efficiently.
                    \item The \gls{acr::smo} can be adapted to an online setting~\parencite{bordes2005fast}.
                    \item The soft margin \gls{acr::svm}, with a right tuning of the slackness parameter $C$, can achieve a good generalization.
                    \item The \gls{acr::svm} is inherently sparse in the sense that it relies only on a small subset of the data which are support vectors.
                            This implies that with a right kernel the \gls{acr::svm} can handle imbalanced datasets.
                \end{itemize}
                On the other hand it suffers also from some drawbacks, listed hereafter:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Finding a the right kernel to represent that data is not a simple task.
                            Even with an expert knowledge, one can easily overfit to the training data.
                    \item In the same sense, parameter fitting is not straight-forward and time-consuming.
                            Practically, it is a result of a trial and error or grid search approach.
                    \item Eventhough it can be adapted to multi-class or multi-output setteings, the \gls{acr::svm} is natively designed for binary classification.
                    \item \gls{acr::svm} does not yield probabilities natively.
                            Although it is possible to compute scores that are in the unit interval, these are difficult to interpret as probabilities.
                \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{\textsc{Random forest}}
            A random forest is an agregation of decision tree classifiers.
            First, is explained how the latter works.
            Afterwards, we describe how the aggregation of basic classifiers can be beneficial for classification, especially in the case of decision trees.
            We end this sub-subsection discussing some random forests properties.

            \paragraph{Decision tree classifier}
                \begin{figure}[htbp]
                    \centering
                    \includestandalone[mode=buildnew, width=\textwidth]{figures/random_forest/decision_tree}
                    \caption{
                        \label{fig::decision_tree_graph} A visualization of a decision tree classifier learned using $I_G$ Gini index over the iris dataset~\parencite{fisher1936use}.
                        Three classes are possible.
                        Each non leaf node states a thresholding condition.
                        For a leaf, its class is presented instead.
                        ``dist.''stands for distribution of classes in each node.
                        The whole decision tree overfits to the data with a $100\%$ overall accuracy ratio.
                        However, when cut at depth 2, the an overall accuracy ratio does not drop noticeably ($96\%$).
                    }
                \end{figure}

                The decision tree classifier consists in successive conditions.
                It is easily modeled as a tree graph rooted at $r$.
                Each non leaf node $b$ in tree takes as input an observation $\bm{x}$ which is fed to logical predicate $P_b$\footnote{$P_b(\bm{x})$ can takle only two values.}: exactly two children are possible per node.
                These predicates are of a specific form: only one dimension $i_b$ of the data is taken into account.
                The output is then computed by applying a threshold $t_b$ to $x_{i_b}$.
                This can be simplified as $P_b(\bm{x}) = \mathbb{1}_{x_{i_b} \geq t_b} $.
                The chosen child is denoted $d_b(\bm{x}) \leftarrow \text{child}(b, \mathbb{1}_{x_{i_b} \geq t_b})$.
                Leafs are the terminal nodes of the tree and they do not apply any predicate to their input.
                Instead, based on the assigned class $c(l) \in \{1,2,\dots,C\}$ of the leaf $l$, they predict the label of the input.
                Each dimension $x_i \in \mathscr{X}_i$ is treated separately.
                Hence, decision trees can handle heterogenous feature vectors that are no longer restricted to be $\mathbb{R}^d$.
                The decision function of a decision tree classifier can be written as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::df_decision_tree}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        D_{\text{decision tree}}: \prod_{i=1}^{d}\mathscr{X}_i &\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,C\}\\
                        \bm{x} &\mapsto c\left(d_{d_{\ddots_{d_r(\bm{x})}}(\bm{x})}\right)
                    \end{aligned}
                \end{equation}
                This representation is complicated and too abstract and is never used.
                The intuitive representation of decision tree classifiers, shown in Figure~\ref{fig::decision_tree_graph}, is generaly prefered.
                In Figure~\ref{fig::decision_tree_separator}, we can clearly attribute the fact that the separator is an aggregation of vertical and horiontal segments to the fact that only one dimension is taken into acount at a time.\\

                \begin{figure}[htbp]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{images/related_work/decision_tree_separator}
                    \caption{
                        \label{fig::decision_tree_separator} Visualization of a decision tree separator trained over generated data in a two dimensional feature space.
                        The separator is composed exclusively of horizontal and vertical lines.
                        We can also see how the decision tree overfits by adding narrow splits to accomodate lone points surrounded by others with an opposite class.
                    }
                \end{figure}

                Up to now, we assumed the fact that the decision tree is already in place.
                The training step of this supervised classifier consists in determining its structure and all the thresholds.
                The goal is to have leafs with no prediction errors.
                In other words, all obsevations that end up in a leaf must be of the same class: the leaf is called pure.
                Consequently, to each node that is not pure would be associated a predicate that would hopefully distinguish amongst incoming observations.
                This is done recursively starting from the root.\\

                The choice of the splitting dimension and the threshold at each node is made in the aim of achieving the most gain in the ``purity'' of child nodes.
                As a consequence, there is a need of a metric $I$ that can describe the heterogenuity, as the opposite of purity, of a node.
                These are usually based on a probabilistic interpretation as they compute the fraction of observations $p_c$ that go through a node of class $c \in \{1, 2, \dots, C\}$.
                Three examples are provided:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Gini index:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::gini}
                        I_G\left(\left(p_c\right)_{c=1, 2, \dots, C}\right) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} p_c \cdot \sum_{\substack{l=1, 2, \dots, C\\l \neq c}} p_l;
                    \end{equation}
                    \item Entropy:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::entropy}
                        I_H\left(\left(p_c\right)_{c=1, 2, \dots, C}\right) = - \sum_{c=1}^{C} p_c \cdot \log_2(p_c);
                    \end{equation}
                    \item Variance:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::variance_index}
                        I_V\left(\left(x_{d_s}^i\right)_{i\in S}\right) = \frac{1}{2 \cdot \vert S \vert^2} \cdot \sum_{(i,j) \in S\times S} \left(x_{d_s}^i - x_{d_s}^j\right),
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        d_s & is the chosen dimension to split over;\\
                        S & $\subset \{1, 2, \dots, n\}$ is an set of indices.
                    \end{conditions}
                \end{itemize}
                Considering $S_b$ the set of indices of inputs going through a node $b$, one can compute the gain of a split at node $b$ as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::split_gain}
                    G_b \triangleq I(S_b) - \sum_{c \in \{d_b(\bm{x}^i): i \in S_b\}} I(S_c)
                \end{equation}
                The optimal splitting dimension and threshold are chosen so that they maximizes the gain $G_b$.
                Details of how this is computed is outside ths scope of this manuscript and is not provided herein.
                For more information on the subject the reader may refer to the work of~\textcite{breiman1984classification}.\\

                Stopping only when total purity is achieved can yield complicated decision trees that overfit easily.
                This motivates the use for some early stopping criteria:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item a minimal number of observations going through each node.
                    \item a minimal purity ratio computed as the ratio of all instances going through the node having the dominant class.
                    \item a maximal depth of the tree.
                \end{itemize}
                To conclude, the class at each leaf is taken as the dominant class of instances entering it.

            \paragraph{Bagging decision trees}
                \begin{figure}
                    \centering
                    \includestandalone[mode=buildnew, height=.4\textheight]{figures/random_forest/ensemble}
                    \caption{
                        \label{fig::ensemble} Illustration of the principle of ensemble methods.
                        For each decision function $\forall l=1,2,3\;D_l$, is represented the set where the each classifier fails $F(D_l) \leftarrow \{(\bm{x}, y) \in \prod_{i=1}^{d}\mathscr{X}_i \times \{1,2,\dots,C\} : D_l(\bm{x}) \neq y\}$.
                        In the case of unweigthed bagging, the aggregated classifier will fail when more than half of the classifiers fail.
                        In this case, the set $F(D_{\text{bagging}})$ is the union of intersections of two different $F(D_l)$: $F(D_{\text{bagging}}) = \bigcup_{l\neq p} F(D_l) \cap F(D_p)$.
                        In this case where classifiers are diverse, the aggregated one fails less frequently than each single one.

                    }
                \end{figure}

                While reducing the complexity of the decision tree can help avoid overfitting problems, one can risk, on the other hand, an underfitting in the classification.
                In order to find a compromise, an ensemble method can be adopted.
                The principle of this type of approaches is to multiply different underperforming classifiers and aggregate them together.
                These classifiers should be taken as diverse as possible in order to cover the whole feature space.
                The aggregation is achieved through a majority vote and, if the classifiers can provide probabilities, the vote can be weighted by the latter.
                This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig::ensemble}.
                Formally, the decision function of an unweighted aggregation of classifiers $\left(D_l\right)_{l=1,2,\dots,L}$ can be written as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::decision_function_hard_ensemble}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        D_{\text{hard ensemble}, \left(D_l\right)_{l=1,2,\dots,L}}: \prod_{i=1}^{d}\mathscr{X}_i &\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,C\}\\
                        \bm{x} &\mapsto \arg \max_{c=1,2,\dots,C}\lvert\{l\in\{1,2,\dots,L\}: D_l(\bm{x}) = c\}\rvert
                    \end{aligned},
                \end{equation}
                while the weighted aggregation using classifier output probabilities $\left(p_l\right)_{l=1,2,\dots,L}$ is expressed as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::decision_function_weighted_ensemble}
                    \begin{aligned}
                        D_{\text{weighted ensemble}, \left((D_l, p_l)\right)_{l=1,2,\dots,L}}: \prod_{i=1}^{d}\mathscr{X}_i &\rightarrow \{1,2,\dots,C\}\\
                        \bm{x} &\mapsto \arg \max_{c=1,2,\dots,C} \sum_{l=1}^{L} p_l\left(D_l(\bm{x}) = c\right) 
                    \end{aligned}.
                \end{equation}

                Bagging is an instance of ensemble approach.
                In order to have different classifiers specializing in a certain pattern, each one is trained on a randomly determined subset of the training data~\parencite{breiman1996bagging}.
                The idea is that each one of these subsets would exhibit a particular aspect that is crucial for the classification.
                The aggregation of each classifier knowledge would eventually help generalize in prediction time.\\

                Random forest do not only rely on a simple bagging but also on a second random sampling: this time it is on the dimensions.
                When splitting a node at training time, only a subset of randomly chosen dimensions is considered~\parencite{breiman2001random}.
                We depict in Figure~\ref{fig::decision_tree_vs_rf} the difference between a random forest and a single decision tree.

            \paragraph{Properties}
                Random forests are often used in practice as they offer some advantages.
                Hereafter are listed some of these:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item As decision trees deal with each feature independently, they can natively, as well as Random Forests, handle heterogenous data.
                        It can handle boolean features along with integer or real ones.
                    \item Since at each time only a subset of features are considered, Random Forests can scale easily under high dimensionality.
                    \item The ensemble character of Random Forests allows them to adapt to outliers and hence have a good generalization power.
                    \item Prediction relies on simple comparisons and can be computed quickly.
                    \item They inherently yield probabilisties that are consistent.
                \end{itemize}
                As with \glspl{acr::svm}, Random Forests have some issues:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item It is not simple to interpret results of Random Forests and connect specific trees to recongnizable patterns.
                    \item They can take up a lot of memory to store all trees.
                            They can also require a lot of computations to train.
                    \item They do not allow the possibility of using kernels to represent the data.
                    \item They does not handle well imbalanced datasets and must be adapted accordingly.
                \end{itemize}
                
    \subsection{\textsc{Feature extraction}}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction}
            Before feeding observations to classifiers, representative features are extracted.
            These are usually vectors from a finite dimensional space called feature space.
            In the previous subsection, we considered a special case of feature spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$.\\

            Feature extraction is not straight-forward.
            It is either hand crafted or learned (using deep learning) to fit a specific need.
            Image feature extraction is one such example where attributes are drawn from images in order to describe specific patterns such as edges~\parencite{canny1986computational}, corners~\parencite{harris1988combined} or \gls{acr::sift}~\parencite{lowe2004distinctive}.
            Herein, we present a specific type of feature extractors called \glspl{acr::scatnet}.
            Images can also be considered as specific type of graphs with a grid structure.
            In the same sense, features can be extracted from graphs.
            We will describe hence how to describe graphs for classification.

        \subsubsection{\textsc{\acrlong*{acr::scatnet} for image classification}}
            \glspl{acr::scatnet} can be seen as a reverse engineered convolutional network.
            They are built mainly relying on wavelet filters which are used to imitate filters from \glspl{acr::cnn}.
            The latter learns automatically an image representation $\Phi$ trying to minimize a learning loss function.
            \Glspl{acr::scatnet}, on the other hand, make use of mathematical properties of the image signal.\\

            Some propeties are always required in order to acheive a good representation $\Phi$ of an image. 
            A scene that is captured from different point of views, while yielding different images, should have close representations.
            Just as with interset point detection~\parencite{harris1988combined,lowe2004distinctive}, the representation of an image should be invariant to scale, translation and rotation~\parencite{mallat2012group,sifre2013rotation,bruna2013invariant}.
            Since images illustrate not only rigid objects, a good representation should allow small local deformations in the signal that can be attributed to distortions of non-rigid objects.\\

            \paragraph{Mathematical notations}
                To formalize these properties, we introduce some mathematical notations.
                \subparagraph{Action of a group}
                    Let $x: u \mapsto x(u)$ be an image (or any signal in general) and $(G, *)$ a group such as the set of translation operators on signals.
                    The action of $g\in G$ on $x$ is written as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_group}
                        L_g(x): u \mapsto x\left(g^{-1}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                
                    As an example, we can study the case of $T_{\mathbb{R}^2}$ a translation group on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
                    This group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$: \textit{i.e.} $(T_{\mathbb{R}^2}, \circ) \cong (\mathbb{R}^2, +)$.
                    Let $v$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
                    We denote a translation by vector $v$ by $t_v: u \mapsto u + v$.
                    Its inverse verifies $t_v^{-1} = t_{-v}$.
                    For $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, we can express the translation applied to signal as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_translation}
                        L_{t_v}(x): u \mapsto x\left(u - v\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    Equally, if we consider the rotation group $SO(2)$ which is isomorphic to the unit circle, and write a rotation of angle $\theta \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)$ as $r_{\theta}$, we express the action of that group as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_rotation}
                        L_{r_{\theta}}(x): u \mapsto x\left(r_{-\theta}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    Rotations and translations are not commutative in the general case.
                    This justifies the definition of roto-translation groups.
                    Let $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\theta \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)$, a member of such a group is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation}
                        g_{\theta, v} \triangleq t_v \circ r_{\theta} = r_{\theta} \circ t_{r_{-\theta}(v)}
                    \end{equation}
                    and its inverse is expressed then as $g_{\theta, v}^{-1} = r_{-\theta} \circ t_{-v}$.
                    Hence we can write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_roto-translation}
                        L_{g_{\theta, v}}(x): u \mapsto x \left(r_{-\theta}(u - v)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                
                \subparagraph{Group convolution}
                    A convolution on a group $G$ is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::group_signal_convolution}
                        x\star y: u \mapsto \int_{h\in G} x(h)\cdot y(h^{-1}(u)) dh
                    \end{equation}

                    For signals $x$ and $y$ that take inputs on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can recognize the usual definition of a convolution:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::translation_convolution}
                        x\star y: u \mapsto \int_{v \in \mathbb{R}^2} x(v)\cdot y(u - v) dv
                    \end{equation}

                    Applied in the rotation case to signals $x(u, \theta)$ on pairs from $\mathbb{R}^2 \times [0, 2\cdot\pi)$, we write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation_convolution}
                        x\star y: (u, \theta) \mapsto \int_{\substack{v \in \mathbb{R}^2\\\omega \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)}} x(v, \omega)\cdot y(r_{-\omega}(u - v), \theta - \omega) dv d\omega
                    \end{equation}
            
            \paragraph{Invariance: formulation}
                $\Phi$ is said to be invariant to $g$ if and only if:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::invariance}
                    \Phi\circ L_g\left(x\right) = \Phi(x),
                \end{equation}
                and covariant if and only if:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::covariance}
                    \Phi\circ L_g\left(x\right) = L_g\circ\Phi(x).
                \end{equation}
                Images of similar objects should have a representations that are also similar.
                Using Euclidean distances as a similarity measure, this property implies $\Phi$ to be contractive~\parencite{bruna2013invariant}.
                Given two images $x$ and $y$, we write:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::contractive}
                    \Vert \Phi(x) - \Phi(y) \Vert \leq \Vert x-y \Vert.
                \end{equation}
                The mapping $\Phi$ should be stable under small local deformations.
                A local deformation is modeled as a diffeomorphism\footnote{A differentiable bijection which inverse is differentiable also.} $\tau$.
                A small one is formalized as a diffeomorphism $\tau$ that verifies $\Vert\nabla \tau\Vert_\infty < 1$~\parencite{bruna2013invariant,sifre2013rotation,mallat2012group}.
                A good transform $\Phi$ , there exists a constant $C>0$ such that for any image $x$:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::stable_deformation}
                    \exists C >0, \forall x \in \mathscr{I}\quad \Vert \Phi(x) - \Phi\circ L_\tau(x) \Vert \leq C \cdot \Vert x\Vert \cdot \Vert\nabla \tau\Vert_\infty.
                \end{equation}
                where:
                \begin{conditions}
                    \mathscr{I} & is the set of all possible signals;\\
                    L_\tau(x) & $u \mapsto x(u - \tau(u))$ is the action of the deformation $tau$ on a signal $x$.
                \end{conditions}

            \paragraph{\gls{acr::scatnet}: a reverse engineered \gls{acr::cnn}}
                \glspl{acr::cnn} learn such a representation which verifies these previous conditions stated in Equations~\ref{eq::contractive},~\ref{eq::invariance} and~\ref{eq::stable_deformation}.
                In fact, it is possible by virtue of some basic building blocs.
                First, since the weights are learned based on a classification objetive, images with similar content are supposed to be mapped to the same region.
                Second, pooling layers in \glspl{acr::cnn} provide a solution for invariance to translations and local deformations up to a scale.\\

                The \gls{acr::scatnet} being a reverse engineered \gls{acr::cnn}, formalizes these ideas using wavelet transforms.
                The idea is to apply linear convolutional operators followed by a non-linearity and some pooling operators.
                In a \gls{acr::scatnet} the learned filters are replaced by a specific wavelet decomposition, the non-linearity is acheived using the modulus operator and pooling is obtained through a low pass filter.
                The low-pass filter is critical for the invariance condition, while the lost high frequencies are retrieved using the wavelet convolutions.
                The non-linearity, just as in \glspl{acr::cnn}, is necessary in order to obtain interesting non-linear final representations.\\

                \subparagraph{Used wavelets}
                    In order to define wavelets:
                    mother wavelet
                    low-pass
                    gives:
                    spatial ones
                    angular ones
                    and roto translation ones

                    if average only spatial then rotation covariance
                    else invariance

                    Based on a band-pass filter $\psi$, one can generate a two-dimentional wavelet filter bank using rotations $r_{\theta}$ and dilatations of scale $j$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::filter_bank}
                        \psi_{j,\theta} = 2^{-2\cdot j}\cdot\psi\left(2^{-j}\cdot r_{-\theta}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    In accordance with these wavelets are defined 
                    $\phi_J: u\mapsto 2^{-2\cdot J}\cdot\phi\left(2^{-\cdot J}\cdot u\right)$
                    Roto-translation wavelets have spatial componenents and angular components.

            When the Fourier transform of $\psi$ is centred at a frequency $\omega$, the wavelet $\psi_{j,r}$ is centered around $\left(2^{-j}\cdot r(\omega)\right)$ with bandwidth propotional to $2^{-j}$.
            Based on these filters is computed the wavelet transform of a signal $x$: $\{x\star\psi_{j,r}\}_{j,r}$.
            Morlet wavelets and a Gaussian low-pass filter are usual choices~\parencite{bruna2013invariant,sifre2013rotation}.
            The basic bloc of a \gls{acr::scatnet} is the wavelet-modulus operator:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq::basic_operator}
                U_{j,r}(x) = \vert x\star\psi_{j,r} \vert.
            \end{equation}
            This can be reapplied successively like with \glspl{acr::cnn} at different scales and rotations:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq::basic_operator}
                U[p](x) = U_{j_m,r_m}\circ U_{j_{m-1},r_{m-1}} \circ \dots U_{j_1,r_1} (x),
            \end{equation}
            where:
            \begin{conditions}
                p & is called a path and is the sequence of parameters $\left((j_i, r_i)\right)_{i=1,2,\dots,m}$.
            \end{conditions}
            A scattering transform at a path $p$ consists in applying a pooling operator $P_J$ on the successive wavelet-modulus operators, using a scaled low-pass filter $\phi_J: u\mapsto 2^{-2\cdot J}\cdot\phi\left(2^{-\cdot J}\cdot u\right)$:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq::scattering_transform}
                S_J[p](x) \triangleq P_J\left(U[p](x)\right) = U[p](x) \star \phi_J
            \end{equation}

            If these filters can cover the whole frequency space then the scattering transform is invertible.
            Moreover, the scattering tranform can be proved to verify all the required conditions~\parencite{mallat2012group}.
            In order to acheive invariance using a low-pass filter, the wavelet-modulus operator operator is required to be covariant with regards to $G$.
            In fact, for $g \in G$:
            \begin{equation*}
                \begin{cases}
                    P_J \circ L_g = P_J\\
                    U[p] \circ L_g = L_g \circ U[p]
                \end{cases}\Rightarrow S_J[p] \circ L_g = S_J[p]
            \end{equation*}

            In order to achieve invariance to scale, an average is computed the scale-space $\log(S(x(2^i\cdot u)))$.
            A logarithm is then applied to the scattering coefficients as well as a global scale space averaging in order to obtain a global image descriptor.

            \begin{figure}
                \centering
                \includestandalone[mode=buildnew, width=\textwidth]{figures/scattering_network}

                    The scattering coefficients are obtained then by a low-pass filter (in blue).
                    In practice, not all scattering coefficients are computed.

            \end{figure}

            In Figure~\ref{fig::scatnet} is represented the \acrlong{acr::scatnet}.
            The number of scattering coefficients is exponential in the network depth.
            Usually, not all coefficients are computed.
            Instead they are computed following a non decreasing frequency path.
            Moreover, most of the energy of the signal is contained in the first two layers.
            This is why, in practice, the computation is stopped at that level.
