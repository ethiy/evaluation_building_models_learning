In this Chapter, a tour of the different notions necessary for the understanding of the present manuscript is presented.
It is divided into three sections.
First, we categorize, in Section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling}, the \gls{acr::3d} building modeling techniques.
A global idea of the subject is required to have a good idea of which defects to expect in evaluated building models.
Secondly, we present a complete state-of-the-art survey on quality evaluation for \gls{acr::3d} building models (cf. Section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::quality}).
In the last Section~\ref{sec::state_of_the_art::mlpr}, are presented the main tools that are used in our proposed approach.
Indeed, we discuss aspects of supervised classification as well as main feature extraction techniques.

\section{Automatic \texorpdfstring{\gls*{acr::3d}}{3D} building modeling}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling}
    In this work, we study the quality evaluation of \textbf{large-scale} urban modeling.
    Building models at city scale cannot be obtained manually.
    Automatically acquired building models are, actually, the first target of our study.
    As a consequence, there is a need for a overview of automatic \gls{acr::3d} building modeling.
    The aim of this section is not to give a thorough survey of all \gls{acr::3d} modeling techniques, but rather explain the main approaches and how they affect the quality of the final product.
    For a comprehensive study of urban reconstruction methods, we refer the reader to the work of~\textcite{musialski2013survey}.\\

    Automatic \gls{acr::3d} building modeling consists mainly on two steps.
    Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::building_extraction} presents the different approaches used in the first step: building delineation.
    Afterwhat, the second step consists in modeling the surface of the building.
    Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::modeling_strategies} presents a general categorization of modeling strategies for buildings.

    \subsection{Building extraction}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::building_extraction}
        In automatic building modeling, in order to model the building surface out of the input sensor data, the building location must first be determined.
        There are actually two ways to approach this problem.
        The first relies on retrieving building footprints out of a \gls{acr::gis} database, such as cadastral ones~\parencite{taillandier2004automatic,durupt2006automatic,horna2007building,ledoux2011topologically,biljecki2017generating,biljecki2019raise}.
        In constrast, the second approach type extracts building outlines directly from the input sensor data~\parencite{poullis2009automatic,lafarge2012creating,nguatem2017modeling,zhu2018large}.
        Both approaches suffer from some shortcomings.\\

        \subparagraph{\gls{acr::gis} databases}
            The first type of approaches relies on the fact that the \gls{acr::gis} database is acquired at the same time as the sensor data.
            Otherwise, there will be no guaranty that the modeled scene has not changed in the meantime.
            For instance, a building can be removed --- as a whole or partially --- between the two data acquisitions.
            This would result in having terrain or vegetation reconstructed as a building part.\\

            Even if the database is guaranteed to be produced at the same time as the input data, there is another issue that must be dealt with.
            In some datasets, building outlines are actually not stored in their original form: they are instead deformed to fit their specifications.
            For instance, buildings smaller than a certain area can be ommitted.
            The specified generalization level can also play a role as small features could be smoothed away.
            A part from this type of issues, the provided building outlines could be erroneous simply due to a faulty, wether manual or automatic, process.\\
        
        \subparagraph{Classification}
            The second family of building extraction techniques is based on the classification of input sensor data.
            As a consequence, the final building delineation quality depends mostly on the input data.
            Contrarily to the first case, there is no redundancy that can help filter out noise in the data.
            Low density \gls{acr::lidar} point clouds (with a density less than \SI{10}{\pts\per\m \squared}) are, for example, too sparse and unstructured for instance to detect exact boundaries between objects~\parencite{michelin2012building}.
            Conversly, images offer an alternative but, as a passive sensor, can suffer from issues related to shadows (of buildings or other urban objects) that are detrimental to building delineation~\parencite{adeline2013shadow}.\\

            The classification process is not flawless either.
            Just as with \gls{acr::gis} databases, classification relies on some \textit{a priori} information that is generally encoded in regularization terms~\parencite{lafarge2008structural,zhu2018large,zeng2018neural}.
            These are needed to retrieve outlines of buildings efficiently.
            However, they can also fail to represent the ground truth faithfully and results in wrong building footprint extraction.

    \subsection{Modeling strategies}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::building_modeling::modeling_strategies}
        Once the building footprint is extracted, the goal is to generalize its \gls{acr::3d} surface out of the input data.
        Several strategies are conducted.
        They can be classified in three categories: Model-driven, Data-driven and mixed approaches.\\

        \subparagraph{Model-driven approaches}
            This type of methods, also called top-down methods, rely on strong assumptions on the type of buildings to be modeled.
            For example, the Manhattan-world class assumes that buildings are an aggregation of boxes~\parencite{vanegas2010building,ledoux2011topologically,arroyo2015dimension,li2016manhattan}.
            This is actually an instance of grammars utilized in procedural modeling.
            In the latter, a set of predetermined rules are used to determine the best shapes, out of a library, in order to better fit the input data~\parencite{lafarge2008structural,koutsourakis2009single,zhou20102,simon2011random,mathias2011procedural,martinovic2013bayesian,nan2015template,demir2015procedural,zeng2018neural}.
            Top-down approaches are usually used when the input data resolution is not sufficiently accurate to directly retrieve detailed architectural features of the building~\parencite{lafarge2008structural}.

        \subparagraph{Data-driven approaches}
            They can also be called bottom-up methods.
            These modeling techniques need very high resolution sensor data in order to retrieve constituing geometric features of the building.
            This is usually achieved using primitive extraction.
            For instance, building surfaces could be viewed as piecewise-planar structures~\parencite{taillandier2004automatic,chauve2010robust,lafarge2012creating,nan2017polyfit}.
            As a consequence, plane arrangements are drawn from the original data.
            Edges are also examples of features that can be extracted from the data to guide building modeling~\parencite{baillard1999automatic}.
            A second step consists in aggregating the extracted geometric features into a single surface.
            This is usually implemented either through a greedy approach~\parencite{taillandier2004automatic} or a global optimization method~\parencite{poullis2013framework,verdie2015lod,zhu2018large,holzmann2018semantically}.

        \subparagraph{Mixed approaches}
            The first type of methods fails to scale for multiple urban scenes as it is contigent on having a comprehensive enough grammar, which is almost never the case.
            On the other hand, the second kind of methods knows other drawbacks as it mainly tends to oversegment facets in order to stay close to the measured data.
            One way to alleviate these issues is to mix the two approaches.
            \textcite{werner2002new}, for instance, fits predetermined shapes (wedges and rectangles) to already extracted edges and planes.
            However, these usually rely on greedy approaches that do not scale well.\\

        \subparagraph{Limitations of current modeling methods}
            There are still some limitations that these automatic approaches did not adress.
            Higher resolution sensors are yielding more and more data with high frequencies that are still not taken into account as most produced models are at most \gls{acr::lod}-2 ones.
            These can pose serious problems in modeling:~\textcite{bredif20073d} proved that undetected superstructures can lead to bad quality models and their reconstruction can help in that regard.
            High buildings can cast shadows on, or occlude, neighbooring ones which results in issues with their surface retrieval.
            This has not been widely studied~\parencite{lafarge2012creating,bao2013generating}, as buildings are moslty modeled one by one and and often not in challenging\footnote{
                Like buildings delimited by narrow streets or ones with complex architectures.
            } areas.
            All these issues induce defects that should be characterized and classified for a better understanding of the field and, subsequently, objectively understand which methods are the most adapted for which areas.

\section{Quality evaluation of \texorpdfstring{\gls*{acr::3d}}{3D} building models}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::quality}
    We have seen previously various methods used to automatically model buildings.
    The goal of this section is to describe the available approaches that evaluate the quality of such models.
    These could be distinguished based on two criteria.\\

    In Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}, are presented the quality evaluation methods based on their output.
    An alternative perspective to characterize quality evaluation methods relies upon the type of reference data (cf. Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}).
    Based on this survey, we state in details, in Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::novelty}, how the approach presented in this thesis is different from what was already proposed in the literature.

    \subsection{Output types}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}
        We distinguish herein quality evaluation methods depending on the kind of output they produce.
        Fidelity metrics constitues a first instance of output types.
        The second is semantic labels.
        In what follows, we explain, in details, the differences between the two types of method.

        \subsubsection{Fidelity metrics based methods}
            One way to characterize the quality of a building model is to compute indices or metrics reporting its geometric accuracy.\\

            Most metrics provide information on the geometric precision of the model.
            They are computed for different geometric objects.
            Below, depending on the geometric dimension of the latter, we categorize the geometric fidelity metrics.\\

            We start with zero dimensional objects: i.e., points.
            In this case, metrics are based on their coordinates.
            The goal is to detect positional inaccuraccies~\parencite{kaartinen2005accuracy}.
            In constrast, the choice of points to be inspected is not simple.
            Corner points resulting from the intersection of edges in the model is one choice.
            In fact,~\textcite{zeng2014multicriteria} registers corner points from the evaluated model and the corresponding reference.
            Based on this registration, a comparison is drawn using \acrfull{acr::rmse}, just as in~\parencite{you2011quality,landes2012quality}.
            The same points are used as a proxy for manual quality inspection by~\textcite{elberink2011quality}.
            Another alternative is to sample points from lines or surfaces to be compared.
            These could be predetermined manually as in~\parencite{kaartinen2005accuracy} or sampled regularly as demonstrated by~\textcite{vogtle2003quality,tran2019geometric}.
            Imprecisions are not computed only relying the \gls{acr::rmse}, but can also be separated into planimetric (\gls{acr::lod}-0) and height inaccuraccies (\gls{acr::lod}-1)~\parencite{vogtle2003quality,jaynes2003recognition,kaartinen2005accuracy}.\\

            Second comes edges and all one dimensional objects in general.
            These convey structural, in addition to positional, information.
            \textcite{kaartinen2005accuracy} compare lengths as well as slopes of edges formed by reference points.
            Edge related metrics are also used as an intermediary as shown by~\textcite{elberink2011quality,michelin2013quality}.
            They are both interested in edges resulting from facet intersections.
            While the first relies on \gls{acr::rmse}, the second computes more complex metrics that compares model edges to ones extracted out of sensor data.\\

            Next are compared surfaces (i.e., two dimensional objects), bounded (for example, polygons) or not (like planes).
            These hold more structural information than the first ones and hence are widely used for evaluation.
            \textcite{rottensteiner2014results} used height discrepancy of roof planes so as to evaluate building models.
            This metric is ideal for Manhattan-world model evaluation, as in the case of~\textcite{zebedin2008fusion}.
            In addition to height discrepancy, normal displacement is computed using always the same \gls{acr::rmse} metric by~\textcite{henricsson19973}.
            Conversely,~\textcite{zeng2014multicriteria} use also a \gls{acr::rmse} for comparison, but not in the Euclidean space.
            In fact, after mapping the evaluated and reference models to a sphere, they compare their spherical harmonic~\parencite{brechbuhler1995parametrization} representations.
            Just as with edges, planes can be evaluated using angular measurements, as was proposed by~\textcite{henricsson19973,landes2012quality}.
            Another alternative is to compare reconstructed and reference models based on surface area comparisons.
            These are mostly based on ratios like completeness and correctness\footnote{In other words, recall and precision, respectively.}~\parencite{henricsson19973,schuster2003new,landes2012quality,rottensteiner2014results}.\\

            Last, are three dimensional (i.e., volume) evaluation.
            The same detection ratios that were computed for surfaces are again calculated to evaluate volumes this times, as shown by~\textcite{jaynes2003recognition,mohamed2013quality, zeng2014multicriteria,nguatem2017modeling}.
            These are the only metrics used for volumes that we are aware of.\\

            Regarding \textit{implicit} semantics, as far as we are aware, only one metric is widely used to evaluate its impact.
            As discussed previously in Section~\ref{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::building_3d_modeling}, compaction is one byproduct of semantics.
            As a consequence, it was used as an index to evaluate reconstructions\footnote{It is sometimes called by its antonym: complexity.}: the more a model was compact the better it was.
            This is reflected, for instance, in the work of~\textcite{lafarge2012creating,duan_eccv16,zhang2017deep,zeng2018neural,zhu2018large}, where this metric is never used alone but always alongside geometric ones.

        \subsubsection{Semantic-based methods}
            \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output::semantic}
            In a drive to provide a quantitative assessment of building models, the previously defined metrics fail to convey specific and localized information about a predetermined building model.
            These indices are usually used to give a general idea of the quality of models produced by some modeling method.
            Moreover, they do not usually carry semantics, which is critical for further processing steps such as manual correction~\parencite{elberink2011quality}.
            Some evaluation methods, in an effort to alleviate these issues, yield semantic labels that describe the errors of an evaluated model.
            Hereafter, are described the different types of labels that were proposed in the literature.\\

            \textcite{boudet2006supervised} was the first ever work, that we are aware of, which tackles semantic labels as outputs of the evaluation.
            This approach has four classes which indicate how valid the model is: ``acceptable'' and ``correct'' portray valid buildings while ``false'' and ``generalized'' are refused.
            It can be seen as a four grade based score system expressing the confidence in a building model.
            The main limitation of this method is the fact that the proposed labels do not specify what defects a model presents if it is not valid.
            It is, therefore, hard to use for model correction.
            Besides, the acceptable defect definitions depend also on each use case.
            For instance, a communications company would be more adament on the accuracy of roof parts, which would affect wave propagation, rather than an insurance company interested in flood damage estimation.
            This means that each use case implies a relabeling that could be potentially different from other one.
            \textcite{durupt2006automatic} used also the same labels to evaluate their reconstruction.\\
            
            The first hints of a fine grained semantic labeling of building model errors lay in the work of~\textcite{rottensteiner2014results}.
            This work was the first to report segmentation issues, at facet level, in labels instead of a global ratio.
            They distinguish between oversegmentation cases, undersegmentation cases and cases where both co-occur.\\

            On the other hand, these mentioned errors are not comprehensive: they do not cover all possible building model errors.
            \textcite{michelin2013quality} came up with a richer taxonomy of errors that are categorized into three big families:
            \begin{description}
                \item[Footprint errors:] these portray errors relative to the building footprint, which is used by many modeling algorithms as input.
                        Errors contained in this family are: ``erroneous outline'', ``unexisting building'', ``missing inner court'' and ``inaccurate footprint''.
                \item[Reconstruction errors:] these are caused by the modeling approach.
                        These defects can be the result of the incompatibility of some \textit{a priori} hypotheses about the scene, for instance.
                        Such errors are: ``under-segmentation'', ``over-segmentation'', ``inaccurate roof'' and ``Z translation''.
                \item[Vegetation errors:] this corresponds to a special case when modeled building are occluded, completely or partially, by higher vegetation.
                        It becomes impossible to evaluate properly these models.
            \end{description}
            Although the last taxonomy is rich, it is not exhaustive enough as it misses cases that are not present in the urban zone that was studied in the paper.
            For instance, the fact of modeling a cone-shaped roof with a piecewise-planar structure is not taken into account in this taxonomy.
            Moreover, it adopts the point of view of the modeling method that was used to provide their dataset.
            Knowing the specific weaknesses of the latter guided the choice of error family classification and the error definitions.
            This is particularly clear when looking at their error categorization.
            In fact, the first error class relates to the fact that the used building modeling approach~\parencite{durupt2006automatic} relies on footprints given as input.
            The second category corresponds to the actual step of building roof structure inference.

    \subsection{Types of reference data}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}
        In order to evaluate models, reference data are utilized for comparison.
        Based on the latter, another way to discriminate among modeling methods is possible.
        The first class of reference data are high quality ground truth \gls{acr::3d} building models.
        Remote sensing data is the second alternative that is used for reference.
        Neither of these two choices do influence the type of output the evaluation method produces.
        Hereafter, is explained the difference between the two categories.

        \subsubsection{High resolution ground truth}
            Ground truth building models are mainly acquired manually.
            Herein, are listed the different ground truth measurement techniques, in descending order of accuracy.\\

            The most obvious case consists in field measurements of the modeled building.
            \textcite{dick2004modelling}, for instance, evaluated their buildings based on manual tape measurements taken on specific architectural features, like windows and columns, with an accuracy of \SI{0.01}{\m} for the first and \SI{0.1}{\m} for the second.
            Complete and scalable measurements of buildings are possible using topographic surveys.
            Using the latter, building models could be reconstructed with precision up to \SI{\pm 0.1}{\m}~\parencite{henricsson19973} or \SI{\pm 0.05}{\m}~\parencite{vogtle2003quality}.\\
            There is also the possibility of manually modeling the building using overhead images, or stereoplotting.
            ~\textcite{zebedin2008fusion} use such a method to produce their reference data from aerial images with an accuracy up to the order of \SI{\pm 0.15}{\m}.
            The same procedure was used also by~\textcite{jaynes2003recognition} producing models with inaccuraccies bounded by \SI[fraction-function = \sfrac]{\pm 1/3}{\m}.

        \subsubsection{Remote sensing data}
            Reference ground truth models are not readily available at large quantities~\parencite{schuster2003new}.
            The previous choice is hard to scale up to district or city levels.
            In fact, they are more suitable to evaluate few building models: e.g., in order to validate a reconstruction method.
            Conversely, remote sensing data are more accessible and could be used, instead, as reference.
            In fact, since these are usually fed as input in modeling methods, it is only reasonable to evaluate the produced models in comparison to the input.
            Listed here, are the different types of remote sensing data and how they could be used for building model evaluation.\\

            \subparagraph{Aerial images}
                These could be original images or preprocessed orthoimages.
                The first class of images are the most precise but the other one is more available.
                Images were used by~\textcite{michelin2013quality} to extract \gls{acr::3d} segments based on plane sweeping techniques.
                Reference edges are filtered out and are used to evaluate the \gls{acr::3d} model (intersection) edges.
                Based on these segments,~\textcite{boudet2006supervised} not only evaluate edges but also corners (i.e., edge intersections) and planes.
                Facets were also evaluated, in~\parencite{boudet2006supervised}, based on correlation functions computed from multiple overlapping overhead images.
                Orthoimages were used also to, for instance, compute \gls{acr::ndvi} scores for vegetation occluded building model discrimination.

            \subparagraph{\gls{acr::lidar} point clouds}
                This type of data have the inherent advantage, compared to images, of directly providing depth information.
                \textcite{kaartinen2005accuracy} used data that was acquired multiple times with a guaranteed precision up to \SI{0.083}{\m} in planimetry and \SI{0.035}{\m} in height.
                Out of the latter were chosen reference points that were compared to equivalents in the evaluated building models (check the previous Section).
                All the points could also be used for comparison by computing metrics such as \gls{acr::rmse}~\parencite{lafarge2012creating,zhu2018large}.
                Original input data is not always accessible.
                One other issue arises when using data from multiple sources where it has to be coregistred in the same reference system.
                This is taken into account by~\textcite{akca2010quality}, before addressing the completeness of building models.
            
            \subparagraph{Height maps}
                These are not sensor data as they are a byproduct of earlier data types.
                Still, they are considered here since they are used as input by some building modeling pipelines.
                Just like with \gls{acr::lidar} point clouds, \gls{acr::dsm} is used for building model comparison based on \gls{acr::rmse}~\parencite{zeng2018neural}.
                \textcite{michelin2013quality}, however, use the same data but differently.
                In fact, \gls{acr::dsm}, being a result of overhead images, can be used as proxy, to help extracting \gls{acr::3d} geometric features instead of recomputing correlation scores like in~\parencite{boudet2006supervised}.
                It can also be valuable for missing court detection by calculating sky viewshed angle scores~\parencite{michelin2013quality}.

    \subsection{Novelty of the proposed method}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::novelty}
        Quality evaluation approaches presented hereinabove are mostly unsuitable for the stated objectives in Section~\ref{subsec::introduction::contributions::positioning}.\\

        In fact, the semantic character of the evaluation overrules approaches relying only on geometry based metrics.
        This represents most of the methods discussed earlier (cf. Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}).
        Actually, these metrics could be used once a semantic error is identified to help quantify the defect.
        Conversely, the need for reasonably available reference data, which is dictated by the \textbf{large-scale} constraint, implies the reliance on remote sensing data based methods (cf. Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}).\\

        There are only two approaches that are both semantic and rely only on more readily available remote sensing data:~\parencite{boudet2006supervised,michelin2013quality}.
        Both define semantic errors that are predicted with the help of overhead images and \glspl{acr::dsm}.
        A classifier learns statistical properties of the \gls{acr::3d} building models using features that are derived from these sensor data.
        The learning process further helps scaling the evaluation pipeline to unseen data by predicting errors using the same attributes.\\

        Our work relies on the same idea, but goes further by allowing the possibility to evaluate building models without using any reference data\footnote{With the exception of training data.} and relying on their intrinsic attributes instead.
        It also offers a new taxonomy of errors that is intended to be exhaustive and generalizable.
        These latter notions are developed in details in Chapter~\ref{chap::semantic_evaluation}, while Chapter~\ref{chap::learned_evaluation} presents how features are chosen to represent building models and the learning process.\\

        In fact, we propose a novel hierarchical and modular taxonomy that assembles all possible semantic and geometric errors that can affect the building model.
        Based on this taxonomy, depending on the end user needs, error labels are extracted for the classification.
        We also developed a baseline of features, intrinsic as well as extrinsic\footnote{If available.}, which describe the evaluated models.
        Using these features so as to train some regular off-the-shelf classifiers, we proved the feasibility of our approach.
        Finally, we made use of some advanced feature extractors with the aim of improving the prediction scores of the proposed pipeline.

\section{Supervised learning and pattern recognition}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::mlpr}
    In this section are presented notions from statistic learning and computer vision domains that were useful for this work.
    This constitutes a simple reminder and is not a thorough survey of the field.
    Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers} start off with a brief description of the utilized supervised classifiers.
    Secondly, Section~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction} presents some advanced feature extraction techniques on which our method is based.

    \subsection{Feature extraction}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction}
            Before feeding observations to classifiers, representative features are extracted.
            These are usually vectors from a finite dimensional space called feature space.
            In the previous subsection, we considered a special case of feature spaces $\mathbb{R}^d$.\\

            Feature extraction is not straight-forward.
            Features are either hand crafted or learned (using deep learning) to fit a specific need.
            Image feature extraction is one such example where attributes are drawn from images in order to describe specific patterns such as edges~\parencite{canny1986computational}, corners~\parencite{harris1988combined} or \gls{acr::sift}~\parencite{lowe2004distinctive}.
            Herein, we present a specific type of feature extractors called \glspl{acr::scatnet}.
            Images can also be considered as a specific type of graph with a grid structure.
            In the same sense, features can be extracted from graphs.
            We will describe hence how to describe graphs for classification.

        \subsubsection{\acrlong*{acr::scatnet} for image classification}
            \label{subsubsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction::scatnet}
            \glspl{acr::scatnet} can be seen as a reverse engineered convolutional network.
            They are built mainly relying on wavelet filters which are used to imitate filters from \glspl{acr::cnn}.
            The latter learns automatically an image representation $\Phi$ trying to minimize a learning loss function.
            \Glspl{acr::scatnet}, on the other hand, make use of mathematical properties of the image signal.\\

            Some properties are always required in order to achieve a good representation $\Phi$ of an image. 
            A scene that is captured from different points of view, while yielding different images, should have close representations.
            Just as with intersect point detection~\parencite{lowe2004distinctive}, the representation of an image should be invariant to scale, translation and rotation~\parencite{mallat2012group,sifre2013rotation,bruna2013invariant}.
            Since images illustrate not only rigid objects, a good representation should allow small local deformations in the signal that can be attributed to distortions of non-rigid objects.\\

            \paragraph{Mathematical notations}
                To formalize these properties, we introduce some mathematical notations.
                \subparagraph{Action of a group}
                    Let $x: u \mapsto x(u)$ be an image (or any signal in general) and $(G, *)$ a group such as, for example, the set of translation operators on signals.
                    The action of $g\in G$ on $x$ is written as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_group}
                        L_g(x): u \mapsto x\left(g^{-1}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                
                    As an example, we can study the case of $T_{\mathbb{R}^2}$ a translation group on $\mathbb{R}^2$.
                    This group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$: i.e., $(T_{\mathbb{R}^2}, \circ) \cong (\mathbb{R}^2, +)$.
                    Let $v$ be a vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
                    We denote a translation by vector $v$ by $t_v: u \mapsto u + v$.
                    Its inverse verifies $t_v^{-1} = t_{-v}$.
                    For $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$, we can express the translation applied to signal as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_translation}
                        L_{t_v}(x): u \mapsto x\left(u - v\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    Equally, if we consider the rotation group $SO(2)$ which is isomorphic to the unit circle, and write a rotation of angle $\theta \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)$ as $r_{\theta}$, we express the action of that group as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_rotation}
                        L_{r_{\theta}}(x): u \mapsto x\left(r_{-\theta}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    Rotations and translations are not commutative in the general case.
                    This justifies the definition of a roto-translation group, called also the rigid motion group and denoted $SE(2)$.
                    Such a group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2 \times SO(2)$.
                    Let $v \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\theta \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)$, a member of such a group is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation}
                        g_{\theta, v} \triangleq t_v \circ r_{\theta} = r_{\theta} \circ t_{r_{-\theta}(v)}
                    \end{equation}
                    and its inverse is expressed then as $g_{\theta, v}^{-1} = r_{-\theta} \circ t_{-v}$.
                    Hence we can write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::action_roto-translation}
                        L_{g_{\theta, v}}(x): u \mapsto x \left(r_{-\theta}(u - v)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                
                \subparagraph{Group convolution}
                    A convolution over a locally compact topological group $G$ is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::group_signal_convolution}
                        x \ostar y: u \mapsto \int_{h\in G} x(h)\cdot y(h^{-1}(u)) \cdot dh
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        dh & is the Haar measure on $G$.
                    \end{conditions}

                    For signals $x$ and $y$ that take inputs on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can recognize the usual definition of a convolution:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::translation_convolution}
                        x \star y: u \mapsto \int_{v \in \mathbb{R}^2} x(v)\cdot y(u - v) \cdot dv
                    \end{equation}

                    Applied in the roto-translation case to signals $x(u, \theta)$ on pairs from $\mathbb{R}^2 \times [0, 2\cdot\pi)$, we write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation_convolution}
                        x \ostar_{SE(2)} y: (u, \theta) \mapsto \int_{\substack{v \in \mathbb{R}^2\\\omega \in [0, 2\cdot\pi)}} x(v, \omega)\cdot y(r_{-\omega}(u - v), \theta - \omega) \cdot dv d\omega
                    \end{equation}
            
            \paragraph{Invariance: formulation}
                $\Phi$ is said to be invariant to $g$ if and only if:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::invariance}
                    \Phi\circ L_g\left(x\right) = \Phi(x),
                \end{equation}
                and covariant if and only if:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::covariance}
                    \Phi\circ L_g\left(x\right) = L_g\circ\Phi(x).
                \end{equation}
                Images of similar objects should have also similar representations.
                Using Euclidean distances as a similarity measure, this property implies $\Phi$ to be contractive~\parencite{bruna2013invariant}.
                Given two images $x$ and $y$, we write:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::contractive}
                    \Vert \Phi(x) - \Phi(y) \Vert \leq \Vert x-y \Vert.
                \end{equation}
                The mapping $\Phi$ should be stable under small local deformations.
                A local deformation is modeled as a diffeomorphism\footnote{A differentiable bijection which inverse is also differentiable.} $\tau$.
                A small one is formalized as a diffeomorphism $\tau$ that verifies $\Vert\nabla \tau\Vert_\infty < 1$~\parencite{mallat2012group,bruna2013invariant,sifre2013rotation}.
                Consequently a good transform $\Phi$ should be Lipschitz stable to deformations:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::stable_deformation}
                    \exists C >0, \forall x \in \mathscr{I}\quad \Vert \Phi(x) - \Phi\circ L_\tau(x) \Vert \leq C \cdot \Vert x\Vert \cdot \Vert\nabla \tau\Vert_\infty.
                \end{equation}
                where:
                \begin{conditions}
                    \mathscr{I} & is the set of all possible signals;\\
                    L_\tau(x) & $u \mapsto x(u - \tau(u))$ is the action of the deformation $\tau$ on a signal $x$.
                \end{conditions}

            \paragraph{\gls*{acr::scatnet}: a reverse engineered \gls*{acr::cnn}}
                \glspl{acr::cnn} learn such a representation in the hopes of verifying these previous conditions stated in Equations~\ref{eq::contractive},~\ref{eq::invariance} and~\ref{eq::stable_deformation}.
                In fact, it is possible by virtue of some basic building blocs.
                First, since the weights are learned based on a classification objective, images with similar content are supposed to be mapped to the same region.
                Secondly, pooling layers in \glspl{acr::cnn} provide a solution for invariance to translations and local deformations up to a scale.\\

                \glspl{acr::scatnet} formalize these ideas using wavelet transforms.
                Actually, \glspl{acr::scatnet} were originally developed to better understand \glspl{acr::cnn}.
                The idea is to apply linear convolutional operators followed by a non-linearity and some pooling operators.
                In a \gls{acr::scatnet} the learned filters are replaced by a specific wavelet decomposition, the non-linearity is achieved using the modulus operator and pooling is obtained through a low pass filter.
                The low-pass filter is critical for the invariance condition, while the lost high frequencies are retrieved using the wavelet convolutions.
                The non-linearity, just as in \glspl{acr::cnn}, is necessary in order to obtain interesting non-linear final representations.\\

                \subparagraph{Wavelets filter bank}
                    We need two sets of wavelets: spatial and angular ones.
                    Spatial wavelet filters are derived based on a mother wavelet $\psi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ as follows:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::translation_filter_bank}
                        \psi_{i,\theta} : u\mapsto 2^{-2\cdot i}\cdot\psi\left(2^{-i}\cdot r_{-\theta}(u)\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    We also need a low-pass averaging filter $\phi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ scaled up to a desired size:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::translation_low_pass}
                        \phi_I: u\mapsto 2^{-2\cdot I}\cdot\phi\left(2^{-I}\cdot u\right)
                    \end{equation}
                    The angular wavelets are computed using $2\cdot\pi$-periodic mother wavelet $\bar\psi: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ scaled as follows:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::angular_filter_bank}
                        \bar\psi_{\xi}: \omega \mapsto 2^{-\xi}\cdot\bar\psi\left(2^{-\xi}\cdot \omega\right)
                    \end{equation}
                    We also define the constant averaging filter\footnote{It corresponds to a zero scale filter.} defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::angular_low_pass}
                        \bar\phi: \theta \mapsto \frac{1}{2\cdot\pi}
                    \end{equation}
                    Based on the spatial filter bank defined in Equation~\ref{eq::translation_filter_bank} and the angular one from Equation~\ref{eq::angular_filter_bank}, we define rigid motion wavelets in the next equations:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation_filter_bank}
                        \forall i\neq I, \theta \neq 0, \xi \neq 0 \quad \tilde{\psi}_{i, \theta, \xi}(u, \omega) &= \psi_{i,\theta}(u) \cdot \bar\psi_{\xi}(\omega)\\
                        \forall \xi \neq 0 \quad \tilde{\psi}_{I, 0, \xi}(u, \omega) &= \phi_I(u) \cdot \bar\psi_{\xi}(\omega)\\
                        \forall i\neq I, \theta \neq 0 \quad \tilde{\psi}_{i, \theta, 0}(u, \omega) &= \psi_{i,\theta}(u) \cdot \bar\phi(\omega).
                    \end{align}
                    The corresponding rigid motion averaging filter is obtained as:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::roto-translation_low_pass}
                        \tilde{\phi}(u, \omega) &= \tilde{\psi}_{I, 0, 0}(u, \omega) = \phi_I(u) \cdot \bar\phi(\omega) \nonumber \\
                        \tilde{\phi}(u, \omega) &= \frac{1}{2\cdot\pi} \cdot \phi_I(u)
                    \end{align}
                    These are separable filters that can help speed up the convolution computations as shown in~\textcite{sifre2013rotation}.
                    In practice, $\psi$(\textit{resp.} $\bar\psi$) are taken as two (\textit{resp.} one) dimensional Morlet wavelets (cf. Figure~\ref{subfig::morlet_filters}), while $\phi$ is taken as a Gaussian~\parencite{sifre2013rotation,bruna2013invariant,oyallon2015deep}.
                    A finite number $L$ of orientations are possible for angle indices: $\theta \in \left\{\frac{l\cdot\pi}{L}: l=1,2\dots,L\right\}$.
                    In Figure~\ref{fig::morlet_vs_learned}, we can see how the designed filter bank is similar to the one learned by a \gls{acr::cnn}.

                \subparagraph{The wavelet-modulus operator}
                    A wavelet transform of a signal $x$ consists in representing it using a wavelet filter bank: $\left(x\ostar\psi_{\lambda}\right)_{\lambda}$.
                    Depending on the transformed signals, two versions of wavelet transforms are possible.
                    If the signal takes one variable $u \in \mathbb{R}^2$ then we write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::wavelet_transform_1}
                        W: x \mapsto \left(x\star\psi_{i, \theta}\right)_{\substack{i=1, 2 \dots, I \\ \theta \in \left\{\frac{l\cdot\pi}{L}: l=1,2\dots,L\right\}}},
                    \end{equation}
                    if it takes two variables $(u, \omega) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times [0, 2\cdot\pi)$ it becomes:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::wavelet_transform_2}
                        \widetilde{W}: x \mapsto \left(x\ostar_{SE(2)}\psi_{i, \theta, \xi}\right)_{\substack{i=1, 2 \dots, I \\ \theta \in \left\{\frac{l\cdot\pi}{L}: l=1,2\dots,L\right\}\\\xi=1,2\dots,\lfloor\log_2(L)\rfloor}}.
                    \end{equation}
                    An image is a discretization of a two dimensional signal.
                    As a consequence, we can only apply the first transform in Equation~\ref{eq::wavelet_transform_1}.
                    The result of such a mapping is an example of a signal to which one can apply the second transform from Equation~\ref{eq::wavelet_transform_2}.
                    For the right choice of wavelets, these operators can be proven to be invertible, contractive and Lipschitz stable to deformations~\parencite{mallat2012group}.\\

                    By applying a modulus we get the basic building bloc of \glspl{acr::scatnet} called the wavelet-modulus operator: $x \mapsto \vert x\ostar\psi_{\lambda} \vert$.
                    This is delineated for the two cases as follows:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::wavelet-modulus_1_2}
                        U_{i, \theta}: x &\mapsto \vert x\star\psi_{i, \theta}\vert\\
                        \widetilde{U}_{i, \theta, \xi}: x &\mapsto \vert x\ostar_{SE(2)}\psi_{i, \theta, \xi} \vert
                    \end{align}
                    These operators are proven to be covariant to translations and rotations~\parencite{mallat2012group,sifre2013rotation}: i.e., for a couple $(v, \vartheta) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \times [0, 2\cdot\pi)$:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::covariance_wavelet-modulus}
                        L_{g_{v, \vartheta}} \circ U_{i, \theta} &= U_{i, \theta} \circ L_{g_{v, \vartheta}}\\
                        L_{g_{v, \vartheta}} \circ \widetilde{U}_{i, \theta, \xi} &= U_{i, \theta, \xi} \circ L_{g_{v, \vartheta}}.
                    \end{align}
                    These conditions may remind the reader of the work of~\textcite{cohen2016group} on \gls{acr::gcnn}.
                
                \subparagraph{The average pooling}
                    Contrarily to~\parencite{cohen2016group}, the pooling operations differ.
                    \glspl{acr::gcnn} rely on max-pooling as standard practice in \glspl{acr::cnn}.
                    This operator is actually covariant to actions of the rigid movement group.
                    \parencite{bruna2013invariant, sifre2013rotation,oyallon2015deep}, however, rely on averaging (or low-pass) filters as pooling operators.

                    Considering the rigid movement as a nuisance,~\parencite{sifre2013rotation} considers invariance with regards to the roto-translation group.
                    To do so they filter any signal $x(u)$ using $\phi_I$ yielding a signal:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::pool_bi-dim}
                        P_I: x \mapsto x \star \phi_I (u).
                    \end{equation}
                    For signals $\tilde{x}(u, \omega)$ they are averaged using $\tilde{\phi}_I$ and giving as ouput:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::pool_bi-dim-angular}
                        \widetilde{P}_I: x \mapsto \tilde{x} \ostar_{SE(2)} \tilde{\phi}_I (u, \omega).
                    \end{equation}

                    These operators are actually invariant to translation and rotation:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::invariance_pooling}
                        P_I = P_I \circ L_{t_v}\\
                        \tilde{P}_I = \tilde{P}_I \circ L_{g_{v, \vartheta}}.
                    \end{align}

                \subparagraph{Scattering coefficients}
                    Applying the first operation~\ref{eq::pool_bi-dim} to the input image defines the first scattering coefficient:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::scatter_input}
                        S_0[x](u) \triangleq x \star \phi_I (u).
                    \end{equation}
                    
                    To the image, the wavelet-modulus operator is applied giving coefficients $U_{i_1, \theta_1}(x)$.
                    The latter is averaged using the second operation from Equation~\ref{eq::pool_bi-dim-angular}.
                    This defines the second layer of scattering coefficients:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::scatter_first}
                        S_1[x](u, i_1, \theta_1) \triangleq U_{i_1, \bullet} \ostar_{SE(2)} \tilde{\phi}_I(u, \theta_1).
                    \end{equation}

                    At the second level is applied the wavelet-modulus operator retrieving the high-frequencies lost after the low-pass filter using yet another time the wavelet-modulus operator yielding:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::cascade_second}
                        \widetilde{U}_{i_2,\xi_2, \theta_2} \circ U_{i_1, \theta_1}(x)
                    \end{equation}
                    Once again, an average pooling is applied to the latter:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::scatter_second}
                        S_2[x](u, i_1, \theta_1, i_2, \theta_2, \xi_2) \triangleq \widetilde{U}_{i_2,\xi_2, \theta_2} \circ U_{i_1, \bullet} \ostar_{SE(2)} \tilde{\phi}_I(u, \theta_1).
                    \end{equation}
                    
                    This can be reapplied further giving cascaded scattering coefficients at level $m$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::scatter_second}
                        S_m[x](u, p_m) \triangleq \widetilde{U}_{\lambda_m} \circ \widetilde{U}_{\lambda_{m-1}} \dots \circ \widetilde{U}_{\lambda_2} \circ U_{i_1, \bullet} \ostar_{SE(2)} \tilde{\phi}_I(u, \theta_1).
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        p_m & $i_1, \theta_1, \lambda_2 \dots, \lambda_{m-1}, \lambda_m$ and is called a path;\\
                        \lambda_k & $i_k, \theta_k, \xi_k$.
                    \end{conditions}

                    The scattering coefficients are proved to be contractive and Lipschitz stable to deformations~\parencite{mallat2012group}.
                    Moreover, they are invariant to actions of the group of rigid movement.
                    In fact, concatenating a covariant operator and an invariant one yields an invariant operator~\parencite{mallat2012group,sifre2013rotation}.

                    The energy of the signal is concentrated along increasing scale paths: i.e., $\forall k = 1, 2, \dots, m-1 \; i_{k+1} > i_k$.
                    This implies that computing coefficients along these paths is sufficient~\parencite{bruna2013invariant,sifre2013rotation,oyallon2015deep}.
                    Furthermore, only the first two layers are computed as they concentrate most the energy of the signal~\parencite{bruna2013invariant,sifre2013rotation,oyallon2015deep}.
                    This yields an efficient way of computing a scattering transform as discussed by~\textcite{sifre2013rotation,oyallon2015deep}.
                    This means that total number of the possible paths is in practice:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::scatnet_number_paths}
                        n_S = \underbrace{1}_{\substack{\text{layer}\\l = 0}} + \underbrace{L \cdot I}_{\substack{\text{layer}\\l = 1}} + \underbrace{\frac{L^2\cdot I \cdot \left(I - 1\right)}{2}}_{\substack{\text{layer}\\l = 2}}.
                    \end{equation}

                    \textcite{sifre2013rotation} go on to propose a way to make the scattering invariant to scale effects also.
                    This is done by introducing a logarithm that linearizes the dependency of scattering coefficients to scales $i_1$ and $i_2$~\parencite{sifre2013rotation,oyallon2015deep}.
                    A scale-space averaging is thus applied to achieve the sought invariance~\parencite{sifre2013rotation}.\\

                    In contrast,~\textcite{oyallon2015deep} propose to keep only the translation invariance and let the classifier decide on the relevance of rotation and scale invariance, much like in~\parencite{cohen2016group}.
                    To do so only a spatial averaging convolution is applied as $x \mapsto \tilde{x}(\bullet, \omega) \star \phi_I$ which is covariant to rotations.
                    Similarly, they drop the scale-space averaging at the end, while the logarithm guaranties the covariance of the signal to scaling effects.
                    The operations are also conducted in a way that renders the shape of the \gls{acr::scatnet}, shown in Figure~\ref{fig::scatnet}, more like that of \gls{acr::cnn}.

                            The scattering coefficients are obtained then by a low-pass filter (in blue).
                            In practice, scattering coefficients are only computed for increasing scale paths up to level $2$.

        \subsubsection{Kernels for graph classification}
            \label{subsubsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::feature_extraction::graph_classification}
            Standard machine learning practice usually assumes that the observed instances live in a finite dimensional space.
            This is not always the case.
            In fact, graphs can have varying numbers of nodes and edges.
            Moreover, they can be different while providing the same structural information: we say they are isomorphic.
            A valid representation for graphs should then take care of these two issues: incorporate all possible graph sizes and be invariant to graph isomorphisms.
            As accustomed in statistical learning, one way to alleviate these issues is to directly compare graphs using kernels as seen previously in Section~\ref{subsubsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers::svm}.\\
            
            This Section does not aim at presenting a thorough survey of graph kernels.
            The work of~\textcite{ghosh2018journey} categorizes graph kernels depending on the used methodology.
            A different approach is proposed in~\textcite{kriege2019survey}, where graph kernels are studied based on the underlying graphs.\\

            Apart from the structure of the graph, kernels should also take into account the labels or continuous attributes assigned to a graph.
            These could be given at node level or edge level.
            We will present hereafter some graph kernels which were used in this work, namely, continuously node attributed ones, as well as those devoted only to its structural properties.\\

            \paragraph{Basic kernels}
                Let $G = \left(V, E\right)$ be an undirected graph with vertices $v\in V$ and edges $e \in E =\left\{\left\{u, v\right\}: (u, v) \in V\times V\right\}$.
                Attributes can be associated to each node $a: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_V}$ or edge $b: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d_E}$.\\

                The most basic graph kernel would correspond to a scalar product of a global hashing vector of all attributes.
                This is possible through the use of a histogram function for instance.
                This type of functions is described in details in Section~\ref{subsec::learned_evaluation::baseline::geometric}.\\

                Let $S\left(\left(a(v)_i\right)_{v\in V}\right): \mathbb{R}^{\vert V\vert} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^l$ (\textit{resp.} $S\left(\left(b(e)_i\right)_{e\in E}\right): \mathbb{R}^{\vert E\vert} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{m}$) be a hashing function that describes the distribution of attributes $i$ of all nodes (\textit{resp.} edges) of graph $G$ as a $\mathbb{R}^{l_i}$ (\textit{resp.} $\mathbb{R}^{m_i}$) vector.
                We can build a node based feature vector for the graph $G$:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::feature_node_graph}
                    \Phi_V(G) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
                        S\left(\left(a(v)_1\right)_{v\in V}\right)\\
                        S\left(\left(a(v)_2\right)_{v\in V}\right)\\
                        \vdots\\
                        S\left(\left(a(v)_{d_V}\right)_{v\in V}\right)
                    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_V \cdot l}
                \end{equation}
                and an edge based one:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::feature_edge_graph}
                    \Phi_E(G) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix}
                        S\left(\left(b(e)_1\right)_{e \in E}\right)\\
                        S\left(\left(b(e)_2\right)_{e \in E}\right)\\
                        \vdots\\
                        S\left(\left(b(e)_{d_E}\right)_{e \in E}\right)
                    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_E \cdot m}.
                \end{equation}

                Based on a base kernel on vectors $\kappa$ (cf. Section~\ref{subsubsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers::svm}), we can compute the similarity between two graphs $G = \left(V, E\right)$ and $G' = \left(V', E'\right)$:
                \begin{align}
                    \label{eq::feature_graph_kernel_nodes}
                    k_V(G, G') &\triangleq \kappa(\Phi_V(G), \Phi_V(G'))\\
                    \label{eq::feature_graph_kernel_edges}
                    k_E(G, G') &\triangleq \kappa(\Phi_E(G), \Phi_E(G')).
                \end{align}
                Concatenating both feature vectors would amount to a simple addition of these kernels:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::feature_graph_kernel_sum}
                    k(G, G') \triangleq k_V(G, G') + k_E(G, G').
                \end{equation}

                This type of kernels is versatile as it can be applied to node and edge attributes as well as labels (with the right choice of hashing function).
                However, it does not take into account the structure of the graph.
                It is mainly used as a baseline for graph feature extraction.
                The work of~\textcite{shervashidze2011weisfeiler} is an example of kernels that uses the same idea to describe graphs while taking account of their structure.
            
            \paragraph{Random walk kernel}
                In order to define this kernel, we need to define the adjacency matrix $A$ of a graph $G$:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::adjacency_matrix}
                    A \triangleq \left(\delta_{\left\{u,v\right\}\in E}\right)_{(u, v) \in V\times V}
                \end{equation}
                and the diagonal matrix of node degrees $D\triangleq \operatorname{diag}\left(\sum_{v \in V}A_{uv}\right)_{u \in V}$.
                We also denote the normalized adjacency matrix as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::normalized_adjacency_matrix}
                    P \triangleq A\cdot D^{-1}
                \end{equation}

                The latter could be interpreted as a transition probability matrix of a random walk on the graph:
                $P_{uv}$ is the probability of choosing $u$ as the next node to visit starting from $v$.
                Similarly, $\left(P^k\right)_{uv}$ expresses the probability of being in node $u$ after $k$ iterations, starting from $v$.
                A random walk starts with an initial distribution $p$ over the nodes.
                After $k$ iterations, the distribution is $P^k\cdot p$.
                At any time, the walk can end with a probability $q_u$ at node $u$.
                $p$ and $q$ are used to encode prior information of the graph~\parencite{vishwanathan2010graph}.\\
                
                \subparagraph{Simultaneous random walk}
                    To compare two graphs \(G\) and \(G'\) using random walks, we start by defining the direct product graph $G_{\times} = \left(V_{\times}, E_{\times}\right)$ where:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::direct_product_graph}
                        V_{\times} &\triangleq V \times V'\\
                        E_{\times} &\triangleq \left\{\left\{(u, u'), (v, v')\right\}: \left\{u,v\right\} \in E \wedge \left\{u',v'\right\} \in E'\right\}.
                    \end{align}
                    This is vizualized in Figure~\ref{fig::direct_product_graph}.
                    \begin{figure}[htbp]
                        \centering
                        \includegraphics[height=.4\textheight]{images/related_work/direct_product_graphs}
                        \caption[
                            Depiction of a direct product of two graphs.

                            \label{fig::direct_product_graph}
                            Depiction of a direct product (bottom) of two graphs (top).
                            Nodes adjacent in the direct product graph $G_{\times}$ correspond to adjacent nodes in both graphs.

                        }
                    \end{figure}

                    For the direct product graph, we compute adjacency matrices, initial probability distribution and stopping probabilities as follows:
                    \begin{align}
                        \label{eq::direct_product_graph_walk}
                        A_{\times} &= A \otimes A'\\
                        P_{\times} &= P \otimes P'\\
                        p_{\times} &= p \otimes p'\\
                        q_{\times} &= q \otimes q'
                    \end{align}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        \otimes & refers to the Kronecker product.
                    \end{conditions}
                    In fact, a random walk on $G_{\times}$ is equivalent to a simultaneous random walk on $G$ and $G'$~\parencite{hammack2011handbook}.\\

                    A random walk on a graph depends heavily on the its structure.
                    In consequence, a random walk on the direct product graph can be used as an indicator of the similarity in structure of both graphs $G$ and $G'$.
                    It is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::random_walk_kernel}
                        k_{rw}(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{k=0}^\infty \lambda_k \cdot q_{\times}^\intercal\cdot P_{\times}\cdot p_{\times}.
                    \end{equation}
                    The choice of the series $\left(\lambda_k\right)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ is critical, as the kernel defined in Equation~\ref{eq::random_walk_kernel} can diverge.
                    It is taken to be non-negative in order in ensure the positive semi-definite of the kernel.\\

                \subparagraph{Special cases}
                    This defintion actually generalizes a family of graph kernels based on walks on graphs~\parencite{vishwanathan2010graph}.
                    Setting $p_{\times} \propto 1$ and $q_{\times} \propto 1$ and, there are two cases of interest:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Let \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^*_+\), we set \(\forall k\in \mathbb{N} \; \lambda_k = \lambda^k\): this gives rise to a geometric random kernel:
                                \begin{equation}
                                    \label{eq::geometric_random_kernel}
                                    k_{grw}(G, G') = \begin{bmatrix}
                                        1, 1\dots,1
                                    \end{bmatrix}\cdot \left(I - \lambda\cdot A_{\times}\right)^{-1}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
                                        1\\
                                        1\\
                                        \vdots\\
                                        1
                                    \end{bmatrix}.
                                \end{equation}
                                Let \(\lambda_{\times}\) the largest eigenvalue of \(A_{\times}\).
                                For this kernel to be valid, the following condition must hold:
                                \begin{equation}
                                    \label{eq::condition_geometric_kernel_convergence}
                                    \lambda < \frac{1}{\lambda_{\times}}
                                \end{equation}
                        \item Let \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^*_+\), we set \(\forall k\in \mathbb{N} \; \lambda_k = \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}\): this yields the so called exponential random kernel:
                                \begin{equation}
                                    \label{eq::geometric_random_kernel}
                                    k_{erw}(G, G') = \begin{bmatrix}
                                        1, 1\dots,1
                                    \end{bmatrix}\cdot \exp\left(\lambda\cdot A_{\times}\right)\cdot\begin{bmatrix}
                                        1\\
                                        1\\
                                        \vdots\\
                                        1
                                    \end{bmatrix}.
                                \end{equation}
                    \end{itemize}
                    These graph kernels were already defined in~\parencite{gartner2003graph}.\\

                Computationally, these kernels involve heavy computations.
                \textcite{vishwanathan2010graph} proposed efficient numerical algorithms to alleviate this problem.
                However, these graphs suffer from other issues.
                First, the kernel does take into account the attributes of graphs if they exist, although it is possible to adapt.
                Secondly, these kernels suffer from tottering.
                The latter being the fact that random walks are mostly consistent of multiple movements between a small subset of vertices in a row.
                Third, related to the previous point, the random walk would spend much time on central nodes that connect to most other nodes adding to their contribution to the kernel, while peripherial ones that can hold the most distinctive feature of the structure are watered down.
                It is possible to address these issues as demonstrated by~\textcite{horvath2004cyclic, mahe2004extensions}.
                However these kernels cannot be guaranteed to be computed in polynomial time~\parencite{vishwanathan2010graph}.

            \paragraph{\gls*{acr::svm} $\vartheta$ kernel}
                This is also a kernel which takes advantage only of the structure of graphs.
                It relies on the definition of Lov\'asz number of a graph $\vartheta(G)$.
                For each vertex $v \in V$, we can assign a unit vector \(\bm{w}_v \in \left\{u \in \mathbb{R}^d: \left\lVert u \right\rVert = 1 \right\}\).
                The set of vectors \(W(G) \triangleq \left(\bm{w}_v\right)_{v \in V}\) is said to be an orthonormal representation of a graph $G$ if and only if:
                \begin{equation*}
                    \forall \left\{u,v\right\} \notin E \Rightarrow \bm{w}_u^\intercal\cdot \bm{w}_v=0.
                \end{equation*}

                \subparagraph{Lov\'asz $\vartheta$ kernel}
                    The Lov\'asz number~\parencite{lovasz1979shannon} is defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::lovazs_number}
                        \vartheta(G) \triangleq \min_{\substack{\bm{c} \in \mathbb{R}^d\\W(G)}}\max_{v\in V} \left(\frac{1}{\bm{c}^\intercal\cdot \bm{w}_v}\right)^2
                    \end{equation}
                    Which can be interpreted as the smallest cone enclosing a valid orthonormal representation of graph $G$.\\
                    Equally, we define the Lov\'asz number over a subset of vertices $B \in V$ as follows:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::lovazs_number_subset}
                        \vartheta_B(G) \triangleq \min_{\bm{c} \in \mathbb{R}^d}\max_{\bm{w}_v\in W_B^*(G)} \left(\frac{1}{\bm{c}^\intercal\cdot \bm{w}_v}\right)^2
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        W^*_B(G) & is the restriction of $W^*(G)$ over the subset $B$;\\
                        W^*(G) & is the maximizer of the problem in Equation~\ref{eq::lovazs_number}.
                    \end{conditions}

                    The Lov\'asz kernel~\parencite{johansson2014global} is defined based on a base kernel $\kappa: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::lovazs_number_kernel}
                        k_{\vartheta}(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{\substack{B\subseteq V\\B'\subseteq V'\\\vert B \vert = \vert B' \vert}} \frac{1}{
                            \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B' \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix}
                        } \cdot \kappa\left(\vartheta_B(G), \vartheta_{B'}(G')\right)
                    \end{equation}

                \subparagraph{Lov\'asz number approximation}
                    The Lov\'asz number is, however, hard to compute~\parencite{johansson2014global}.
                    An approximation is possible using the work of~\textcite{jethava2013lovasz}.
                    It presents an alternative definition of Lov\'asz number.
                    We define $$L \triangleq \left\{K \in S_{\vert V \vert}^+: \forall v \in V, K_{vv} = 1 \wedge \forall \left\{u, v\right\}  \notin E, K_{uv} = 0\right\}$$ where $S_{\vert V \vert}^+$ is the set of $\vert V \vert \times \vert V \vert$ positive semi-definite matrices.
                    We can hence write:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::lovazs_number_alternative}
                        \vartheta(G) = \min_{K \in L} \omega(K)
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \omega(K) = \max_{\alpha_v > 0, \forall v \in V} 2\cdot \sum_{v\in V} \alpha_v - \sum_{(u, v) \in V\times V} \alpha_u \cdot \alpha_v \cdot K_{uv}
                    \end{equation}
                    is dual one-class \gls{acr::svm} (cf. Section~\ref{subsubsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::classifiers::svm}).

                    If $\lambda_m$ is the minimum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A$ (cf. Equation~\ref{eq::adjacency_matrix}), for $\rho\geq-\lambda_m$, the matrix
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::ls_matrix}
                        K_{LS} \triangleq \frac{1}{\rho} \cdot A + I \in S_{\vert V \vert}^+
                    \end{equation}
                    is interesting as $\omega(K_{LS}) = \sum_{v\in V} \alpha_v$~\parencite{jethava2013lovasz}.
                    It is even more interesting, since for Erdos–R\'enyi random graphs, $\omega(K_{LS})$ is a constant factor approximation to the Lov\'asz number~\parencite{jethava2013lovasz} with high probability.

                    This justifies the definition of the kernel:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::svm_kernel}
                        k_{svm}(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{\substack{B\subseteq V\\B'\subseteq V'\\\vert B \vert = \vert B' \vert}} \frac{1}{
                            \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B' \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix}
                        } \cdot \kappa\left(\sum_{v\in B} \alpha_v, \sum_{v\in B'} \alpha_v\right).
                    \end{equation}
                    This is still very prohibitive in terms of computational complexity as one has to sum over all $2^{\vert V \vert}$ (\textit{resp.} $2^{\vert V' \vert}$) subsets of $V$ (\textit{resp.} $V'$).
                    To avoid this issue, for each graph, only a set \(\mathscr{S}\) (\textit{resp.} \(\mathscr{S}'\)) of few of the subsets of \(G\) (\textit{resp.} \(G'\)) are visited:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::svm_approximated_kernel}
                        \hat{k}_{svm}(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{\substack{B\in \mathscr{S}\\B'\in \mathscr{S}'\\\vert B \vert = \vert B' \vert}} \frac{1}{
                            \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
                                \vert V \vert\\
                                \vert B' \vert                            
                            \end{pmatrix}
                        } \cdot \kappa\left(\sum_{v\in B} \alpha_v, \sum_{v\in B'} \alpha_v\right).
                    \end{equation}

            \paragraph{Multiscale Laplacian kernel}
                Related to random walks on graphs, the Laplacian characterizes the structure of graphs, especially its low eigenvalue eigenvectors~\parencite{kondor2016multiscale}.
                It is defined as:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::laplacian_graph}
                    \widetilde{L} \triangleq D - A
                \end{equation}

                \subparagraph{Comparing same size Laplacians}
                    When $\vert V \vert = \vert V' \vert$, we can directly compare the two matrices.
                    The idea of a Laplacian graph kernel $k_{l}$ is to compare the two matrices by comparing related Gaussian probability distribution.
                    In fact, using a Gaussian graphical model, based on a graph $G$ and node variance $\frac{1}{\eta}$, for a random variable $\bm{x}$ is equivalent to:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::guassian_gm}
                        \bm{x} \sim \mathscr{N}\left(0, \left(L + \eta \cdot I\right)^{-1}\right).
                    \end{equation}

                    Using a Bhattacharyya kernel on probabilities and a regulizer parameter $\gamma>0$, we define~\parencite{kondor2016multiscale}:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::laplacian_kernel}
                        k_{l}(G, G') \triangleq \frac{\left\lvert \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(L^{-1}+\gamma\cdot I\right)^{-1} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(L^{\prime -1}+\gamma\cdot I\right)^{-1} \right)^{-1} \right\rvert^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\left\lvert L^{-1} + \gamma \cdot I\right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}\cdot\left\lvert L^{\prime -1} + \gamma \cdot I\right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}}.
                    \end{equation}
                    The \(\gamma\) regulizer term is added in so as to avoid numerical issues when the one of the Laplacians has eigenvalues equal or close to zero.
                    The Laplacian is not invariant to permutations as the graph as described in~\textcite{kondor2016multiscale}.
                    Moreover, both graphs are required to be of the same size.\\

                    This kernel is not well adapted.
                    To alleviate this issue,~\textcite{kondor2016multiscale} propose to describe the graph nodes by vertex permutation invariant features.
                    If $U$ (\textit{resp.} $U'$) is a matrix which encodes such a transformation for graph $G$ (\textit{resp.} $G'$), $k_{l}$ is adapted in what is called feature space Laplacian graph kernel:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::feature_laplacian_kernel}
                        k_{fl}(G, G') \triangleq \frac{\left\lvert \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot S^{-1} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot S^{\prime -1} \right)^{-1} \right\rvert^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\left\lvert S\right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}\cdot\left\lvert S' \right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}}
                    \end{equation}
                    where 
                    \begin{description}
                        \item[\(S =\)] \(U\cdot L^{-1}\cdot U^\intercal + \gamma \cdot I\);
                        \item[\(S' =\)] \(U\cdot L^{\prime -1}\cdot U^\intercal + \gamma \cdot I\);
                        \item[\(L = \)] \(\widetilde{L} + \eta \cdot I\).
                    \end{description}

                \subparagraph{Node attribute aware Laplacian comparison}
                    Up to now, only the structure of the graph is taken into account.
                    To that extent, utilizing a base kernel $\kappa$ on node attributes, first is defined the Gram matrix
                    \begin{equation*}
                        K=\left(\kappa\left(u, v\right)\right)_{(u,v) \in V \cup V'} \in \mathbb{R}^{\left(\vert V \vert + \vert V' \vert\right) \times \left(\vert V \vert + \vert V' \vert\right)}.
                    \end{equation*}
                    Let $\left\{ (\lambda_1, e_1), (\lambda_2, e_2)\dots,(\lambda_p, e_p) \right\}$ be all\footnote{$p \leq \vert V \vert + \vert V' \vert$.} its eigenvalues and their eigenvectors such that $\forall i = 1, 2 \dots, p,\; \lambda_i > 0$.
                    We also need to define
                    \begin{equation*}
                        \widetilde{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
                            \sqrt{\lambda_1}\cdot e_1, \sqrt{\lambda_2}\cdot e_2 \dots, \sqrt{\lambda_p}\cdot e_p
                        \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}.
                    \end{equation*}
                    For graph \(G\) (\textit{resp.} \(G'\)), the first $\vert V \vert$ (\textit{resp.} the last $\vert V' \vert$) rows of $\widetilde{Q}$ are taken from $Q$ (\textit{resp.} $Q'$).
                    Both these matrices are needed to define 
                    \begin{align*}
                        \bar{S} = Q^\intercal\cdot L ^{-1}\cdot Q + \gamma \cdot I\\
                        \bar{S}' = Q^{\prime T}\cdot L^{\prime -1}\cdot Q' + \gamma \cdot I.
                    \end{align*}
                    The generalized feature space Laplacian graph kernel is hence defined as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::generalized_feature_laplacian_kernel}
                        k^{\kappa}_{gfl}(G, G') \triangleq \frac{\left\lvert \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \bar{S}^{-1} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \bar{S}^{\prime -1} \right)^{-1} \right\rvert^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\left\lvert \bar{S}\right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}\cdot\left\lvert \bar{S}' \right\rvert^{\frac{1}{4}}}.
                    \end{equation}

                \subparagraph{Multiscale Laplacian comparison based kernel}
                    The last kernel restricted to a subgraph can in fact be used as a base kernel for the same type of kernels, but at a larger scale.
                    In fact, considering a nested sequence of $L$ sets (neighborhoods) containing $v \in V$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::centered_nested_subgraphs}
                        v \in N_1(v) \subseteq N_2(v) \dots \subseteq N_L(v) \subseteq V.
                    \end{equation}
                    Let us denote by $G[A]$ the induced subgraph by $A \subseteq V$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::induced_subgraph}
                        G[A] \triangleq (A, \left\{\left\{u, v\right\} \in E: (u, v) \in A \times A \right\}).
                    \end{equation}

                    The Multiscale Laplacian Subgraph kernels are base kernels:
                    \begin{align}
                        \kappa_0(v, v') &\triangleq \kappa(v, v')\\
                        \forall l = 1, 2\dots,L \quad \kappa_l(v, v') &\triangleq k^{\kappa_{l-1}}_{gfl}\left(G[N_1(v)], G'[N'_1(v)]\right).
                    \end{align}
                    Finally, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernel is defined using the last base kernel:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::multiscale_laplacian_kernel}
                        k_{msl}(G, G') \triangleq k^{\kappa_L}_{gfl}(G, G')
                    \end{equation}
                    These kernels could be estimated efficiently by computing once the $\bar{S}$ matrices for all graphs, all multiscale base kernels for all nodes and using a low rank approximation.
                    More details are available in the original paper~\parencite{kondor2016multiscale}.

            \paragraph{Propagation kernel}
                The propagation kernel was proposed by~\parencite{neumann2016propagation} and combines ideas from~\parencite{shervashidze2011weisfeiler} with random walks.
                It relies on a simple kernel:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::simple_kernel}
                    k_s(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{(v, v') \in V\times V'} \kappa(v, v')
                \end{equation}
                where $\kappa$ is a base kernel on node attributes\footnote{It can accomodate also the case of labeled and partially labeled graphs.}.\\

                In order to take advantage of the structure of the graph, attributes are propagated using a matrix $T$ giving a new graph $G_t$ at each time $t$, where $G_0 = G$.
                If not given by the user, \(T\) is taken to be the normalized adjacency matrix $P$ (cf. Equation~\ref{eq::normalized_adjacency_matrix}).
                Once the attributes are propagated, the kernel from Equation~\ref{eq::simple_kernel} is computed for the new graphs.
                At time $t_{\max}$, we compute the propagation kernel:
                \begin{equation}
                    \label{eq::propagation_kernel}
                    k_p(G, G') = \sum_{t=1}^{t_{\max}} k_s(G_t, G_t').
                \end{equation}
                Two points are still to be discussed.
                First, the type of base kernels to use, and secondly, the attribute propagation scheme.\\

                \subparagraph{Efficient base kernels through hashing}
                    Knowing the corresponding feature vector extractor $\phi_s(G)$ makes the computation of the simple graph kernel efficient~\parencite{shervashidze2011weisfeiler,neumann2016propagation}.
                    This is possible provided a base kernel of the form: $\kappa(u, v) = \mathbb{1}_{h(u) = h(v)}$, where $h$ is a hash function defined over nodes.
                    By binning values $h(u)$ in a graph $G$ and encoding the results in a vector $\phi_s(G) = b_h(G)$, the simple graph kernel can be expressed as:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::simple_kernel_binning}
                        k_s(G, G') \triangleq b_h(G)^\intercal\cdot b_h(G').
                    \end{equation}
                    The used hash function is the Locality sensitivity hashing~\parencite{neumann2016propagation}.\\

                \subparagraph{Node attribute propagation}
                    Nodes attributes are not directly hashed.
                    Instead, the latter are taken, at time $t$ and for node $u$, as samples of mixtures of Gaussian multivariate distributions $q_{t, u}$ using coefficients $W_t$ at each time $t$:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::attribute_samples}
                        q_{t, u} \sim \sum_{v \in V} W_{uv}\cdot \mathscr{N}(a(v), \Sigma)
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        \Sigma & is the $d_V \times d_V$ covariance matrix based on attributes $\left(a(v)\right)_{v\in V}$.
                    \end{conditions}
                    To propagate these distributions at the next iteration, the mixture coefficients are diffused using the already predefined $T$: $W_{t+1} = T\cdot W_t$.
                    At initialization, $W_0 = I$ and hence $W_t= T^t$.

            \paragraph{Graph hopper kernel}
                Random walk kernels, just as the basic kernels defined in Equations~\ref{eq::feature_graph_kernel_nodes} and~\ref{eq::feature_graph_kernel_edges} and propagation kernels, are instances of R-convolution kernels~\parencite{haussler1999convolution}: i.e., they can be written as a sum of kernels of substructures of graphs.
                In the case of the class of kernels defined in Equation~\ref{eq::random_walk_kernel}, it can be decomposed into a sum of kernels on all equal length walks from both graphs \(G\) and \(G'\)~\parencite{vishwanathan2010graph}.
                In order to deal with issues of these kernels, the shortest path kernel~\parencite{borgwardt2005shortest} proposes to replace walks by shortest paths between pairs of vertices.
                The graph hopper kernel proposes also to compare pairs of nodes from two graphs in a scalable way~\parencite{feragen2013scalable}.

                \subparagraph{Path kernel}
                    A path \(\pi\) between two vertices \((v_s,v_e) \in V\times V\) is a sequence of nodes \(\left(\pi_i\right)_{i=1,2\dots,\vert \pi \vert}\) such that:
                    \begin{equation*}
                        \begin{cases}
                            \forall i=1,2\dots,\vert \pi \vert-1,\; \{\pi_i, \pi_{i+1}\} \in E\\
                            v_s = \pi_1\\
                            v_e = \pi_{\vert \pi \vert}
                        \end{cases}
                    \end{equation*}
                    The set of all shortest paths between nodes of graph \(G\) (\textit{resp.} \(G'\)) is denoted \(\mathscr{P}\) (\textit{resp.} \(\mathscr{P}'\)).

                    Let \(\left(\pi, \pi'\right) \in \mathscr{P} \times \mathscr{P}'\).
                    To compare both paths, a path kernel is defined:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::path_kernel}
                        k_p(\pi, \pi') \triangleq \sum_{i=1}^{\vert \pi \vert} \kappa\left(\pi_i, \pi'_i\right) \cdot \mathbb{1}_{\vert \pi \vert = \vert \pi' \vert}
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        \kappa & is a base kernel on node attributes.
                    \end{conditions}
                    This kernel compares paths with similar length by hopping along them simultaneously.

                \subparagraph{Efficient path based graph kernel}
                    Based on this path kernel, one can compare two graphs \(G\) and \(G'\) by comparing paths from both:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::graph_hopper_kernel}
                        k_{gh}(G, G') \triangleq \sum_{(\pi, \pi') \in \mathscr{P} \times \mathscr{P}'} k_p(\pi, \pi').
                    \end{equation}
                    Defining \(w(v, v')\) as the number of times \(v\) and \(v'\) appear at the same coordinate \(i\) of some shortest paths \(\pi\) and \(\pi'\) with the same length \(\vert \pi \vert = \vert \pi' \vert\), this kernel can be computed efficiently as it can be transformed into:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::graph_hopper_kernel_second}
                        k_{gh}(G, G') = \sum_{\substack{v \in V\\v' \in V'}} w(v, v')\cdot \kappa(v, v').
                    \end{equation}
                    Let \(\delta \triangleq \max_{\pi \in \mathscr{P}} \vert \pi \vert\) the maximal length of shortest paths in \(G\).
                    Define also the \(\delta \times \delta\) matrix
                    \begin{equation*}
                        M_G(v) \triangleq \left(\left\lvert\left\{\pi \in \mathscr{P}: \pi_i = v \wedge \left\lvert\pi\right\rvert = j \right\}\right\rvert\right)_{\substack{i=1,2\dots,\delta\\j=1,2\dots,\delta}}
                    \end{equation*}
                    which in row \(i\) and column \(j\) stores how many times does \(v\) appear as the \(i\)\textsuperscript{th} member of paths of length \(j\).
                    We can see that:
                    \begin{equation}
                        \label{eq::w_as_matrix_inner_product}
                        w(v, v') = \langle M_G(v), M_{G'}(v')\rangle_F
                    \end{equation}
                    where:
                    \begin{conditions}
                        \langle \bullet, \bullet \rangle_F & is Frobenius inner product on matrices.
                    \end{conditions}
                    This quantity can be computed efficiently for each graph with a time complexity two orders of magnitude less than that of basic shortest paths kernel~\parencite{feragen2013scalable}.

    \subsection{Overview}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::mlpr::overview}
        The goal of this section was to introduce some techniques that are later used in our evaluation approach.
        To summarize, we first introduced the two classifiers that are going to be used for learning and predicting error labels.
        In fact, we explained how both function in order to better anticipate and interpret the results later on.
        In a second time, we presented some advanced feature extractors that will be utilized to describe the evaluated models efficiently.
        Indeed, we have shown how the \gls{acr::scatnet} is a good alternative to the state-of-the-art \glspl{acr::cnn} for image classification, especially when the number of learning instances is reduced, as will prove to be our case.
        Regarding graphs, we introduced kernels which help take the graph structure, as well as node attributes, into account.
        Now that the building bricks of our approach are explained, we will procede to illustrate our proposed method in finer details.
