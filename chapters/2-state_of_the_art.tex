\section{Quality evaluation of \gls*{acr::3d} building models}
    \label{sec::state_of_the_art::quality}
    We have seen previously the various methods used to automatically model building.
    The goal of this section is to describe the available approaches that evaluate the quality of such models.
    These could be distinguished based on two criterea.
    In subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output} are presented the quality evaluation methods based on their output.
    An alternative prespective is possible to interpret quality evaluation methods, as it can be relied upon the type of needed reference data to categorize them (\textit{cf.} subsection~\ref{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::reference}).

    \subsection{Output types}
        \label{subsec::state_of_the_art::quality::output}
        We distinguishe here quality evaluation methods based on the output they produce.
        The first type is denoted fidelity metrics.
        The second one is semantic labels.
        Both are explained, hereafter, in details.

        \subsubsection{Fidelity metrics based methods}
            One way to charecterize the geometric quality of a building model is to compute indices or metrics describing its precision.\\

            Most metrics usually inform on the geometric precision of the model.
            They are computed at different dimensions.\\
            The quality of points correspond to zero dimensional objects that could evaluated.
            It is easy to do so based on their coordinates.
            Conversly, the choice of points to be inspected is not evident.
            One choice is to is \\

            There is only one sementic aware indices in the literatture that is used for evaluation.
            In fact, the compacity of \gls{acr::3d} models is a byproduct of their semantic nature.
