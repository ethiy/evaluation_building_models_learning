    \subsection{Applications of urban 3D models}
        Many application cases:
        \paragraph{Urban challenges}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cadastral data management: 3ddelft
            \item Urban planning simulation from cadastral data: brassebin, simplu
            \item Vehicule flow description: VarCity
            \item Wave propagation simulation : telecomunication companies
            \item traffic noise simulation
            \item Public concertation and decision making
            \item flood simulation for insurers owners decision makers
            \item fire hazards and propogation
        \end{itemize}
        \paragraph{Sustainable developpement}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Energy consumption simulation
            \item solar exposure
            \item microclimate simulation (jakarto quebec city, sylvie daniel)
        \end{itemize}
        \paragraph{Autonomous navigation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Outdoor Localisation (Le Petit: osm + extrusion)
            \item civilian space inteligent navigation (alahi)
            \item industrial assistance
        \end{itemize}
        \paragraph{Entertainement industry}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item realistic games (Call of duty: Paris)
            \item Tourism VarCity
            \item Marketing -> Amine
        \end{itemize}
        \paragraph{Security challenges}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Emergency planning
            \item (Para)Military intervention simulation
            \item Marketing: Grand Paris
        \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Building 3D modeling}
        BIM is not easy and always available: old buildings.\\
        Acquire urban scene geometry from sensor data. + manual/highly expensive + Crowdsourcing: sketchup + building plans. large scale => first\\
        Multiple objects: city furniture, transportation vehicules, grass \& trees, water bodies (artificial lakes ...), roads, bridges, humans and buildings.\\
        Not all same duration. Furniture + vehicules + trees ... change but mostly roads and buildings do not.\\
        Roads are easy and Buldings are generally not. + most land cover. => important to model.\\
        LODS\\
    \subsection{Obstacles in Building 3D modeling}
        Widely studied in more than 20 years.\\
        Automatizing\\
        trade-off between fidelity and compactness\\
        Needs manual corrections in high lods.\\
        Indoor open + facade parsing\\
