The goal of this introduction is to acquaint the reader with concepts that are manipulated in this study.
In section~\ref{sec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction}, we illustrate what is meant by urban \index{urban!\gls{acr::3d}!model}\gls{acr::3d} models, and specifically, \index{building!model} building \gls{acr::3d} models.
The role of this chapter is to also motivate the need for a semantic \index{building!model!evaluation}evaluation of such models.
Indeed, in section~\ref{sec::introduction::building_model_evaluation}, we address different aspects of building \index{urban!\gls{acr::3d}!model}\gls{acr::3d} model inspection and the issues it raises.
We conclude by stating our contributions (cf. section~\ref{sec::introduction::contributions}) and the structure of the thesis (cf. section~\ref{sec::introduction::structure_of_thesis}).

\section{Urban \acrshort*{acr::3d} reconstruction}
    \label{sec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction}
    \index{\gls{acr::3d}!reconstruction}\gls{acr::3d} reconstruction is a wide research field that interests \index{photogrammetry}Photogrammetry, \index{computer vision}Computer Vision and \index{computer graphics}Computer Graphics communities.
    In summary, the main idea is, using some input sensor data (\gls{acr::lidar} point clouds or stereo images), to acquire the \gls{acr::3d} surface that bounds an object fo interest.
    In \index{\gls{acr::gis}}\gls{acr::gis}, \gls{acr::3d} data is instrumental to model the Earth surface at different scales.
    In particular, the field takes a special focus in \index{urban!area}urban areas.
    Objects present in such scenes obey usually some specific rules that constrain their shape.
    In this section, we dicuss applications of \index{urban!\gls{acr::3d}!model}urban \gls{acr::3d} models (cf. subsection~\ref{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::applications}).
    We tackle, afterwards, the field \index{building!\gls{acr::3d}!model} building \gls{acr::3d} modeling and the issues it raises(cf. subsection~\ref{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::building_3d_modeling}).
    This section ends, in subsection ~\ref{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::challenges}, with a listing of some important technical challenges that are still to be overcome in this domain.

    \subsection{Applications of urban \gls*{acr::3d} models}
        \label{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::applications}
        In what follows, we present a brief survey of \index{urban!model!application} urban \gls{acr::3d} models applications.
        A more comprehensive study was presented in~\textcite{ijgi4042842}.
        The goal is to persuade the reader of the relevance of urban \index{urban!\gls{acr::3d}!model}\gls{acr::3d} modeling and how much concerned can everybody be, in a way or another.

        \subsubsection{Urban planning related challenges}
            Urbanization raises some serious issues that need to be adressed.
            Consequently, decision makers, and all stakeholders in general, need to have at their disposal adequate tools.
            \index{\gls{acr::3d}!model}\gls{acr::3d} models are, in this sense, suitable as shown hereafter.\\
            Cadastral data, since conception, was presented in the form of \index{\gls{acr::2d}!maps}\gls{acr::2d} maps\addref.
            Although many urban planning norms were always formulated taking into account height, or depth, information \addref, the need for a \index{\gls{acr::3d}!cadastre}\gls{acr::3d} cadastral management was made relevant with the advent of complex architectural features~\textcite{ijgi4042842}.
            To illustrate this case, we show, in figure~\ref{fig::3d_cadastre_need_example}, how \gls{acr::2d} cadastral maps are insufficient when it comes to modeling overhangs.
            \todo{comment figure.}\\
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{\label{fig::3d_cadastre_need_example} Example of a problematic situation where \gls{acr::3d} cadastre would be of help. Overhangs are hard to model in \gls{acr::2d}.}
            \end{figure}
            While \index{\gls{acr::3d}!cadastre}\gls{acr::3d} cadastre describes an urban scene at a certain time for fiscal purposes, urban plannars need the access to the same kind of information but in the future also.
            In fact, they need to know in advance the impact of urban norms they write on the evolution of their zone of interest. 
            One of the issues they study is \index{urban sprawl}urban sprawl~\parencite{ludlow2006urban}.
            The goal is to limit, as far as possible, \index{land occupation}land occupation~\parencite{TANNIER2012128} and predict the shape of the urban scene~\parencite{brasebin20183d} by tuning local urban plans.
            This can be acheived, for instance, through simulation, at different scales, based on a formal description of urban planning norms as shown by the work of~\textcite{Colomb17a}.
            In reality, the \gls{acr::2d} city footprint is not sufficient to assess its capacity to contain people.
            One has to compute the number of habitable units, which depends on the height of buildings.
            This motivates the need of \gls{acr::3d} data as shown in Figure~\ref{fig::3d_simulation}.
            The \index{vizualation} vizualation and \index{simulation}simulation of urban zones can be equally helpfull for \index{public consultation}public consultation~\parencite{WU2010291}.\\
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::3d_simulation} Example of \gls{acr::3d} urban scene simulated from known urban norms.
                    Urban planners can assess the projected urban density of future districts for better decision making.
                }
            \end{figure}
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::public_consultation} Example of public consultation tools using urban \gls{acr::3d} models.
                }
            \end{figure}
            Related to urban planning, \gls{acr::3d} models could be used as a reference for other planners.
            It could be used to describe the flow of vehicles and pedestrians in an urban environement as illustrated in~\textcite{Vanhoey:2017:VVS:3084363.3085085}.
            In addition, it could be used in physical simulations for urban applications.
            For instance, Communication companies need to have a \gls{acr::3d} model of urban scenes to predict signal propagation in the goal of optimal network planning~\parencite{yun2007radio}.
            It can be useful also for flood simulation.
            Predicting the height of overflowing water requires inherently a \gls{acr::3d} information.
            This is the usecase of~\textcite{varduhn2015multi}, where \gls{acr::3d} models are used to assess the flood risk.
            Such information could be instrumental for evacuation planning or for insurance managers.
            In the same direction, one can simulate fire propagation~\parencite{dimitropoulos2010fire} or estimating noise propagation in urban scenes~\parencite{stoter20083d} (\textit{cf.} Figure~\ref{fig::noise_propogation}).
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::noise_propogation} Example of noise propagation simulation using \gls{acr::3d} city models.
                }
            \end{figure}
            All these simulation derived informations could be fed to decision makers in order to better plan the cities of tomorrow.

        \subsubsection{Environemental challenges}
            Environement preservation is a all the more important in the coming years.
            Urban settlement are one of the most biggest energy consumers.
            A more efficient energy utilization is necessary to sustain the frantic growth of urban areas.
            This motivates the need to quantify the energy consumption of urban settlements~\parencite{WATE20153372} or retrofitting costs~\parencite{previtali2014automatic}.
            ~\textcite{biljecki2015propagation} use also \gls{acr::3d} models of buildings in order to predict solar irradiation.
            In fact, solar potential estimation can be useful for assessing the benefits of expensive solar panels projects.\\
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::solar_potential} Solar potential estimation using building \gls{acr::3d} models.
                    The slope, oriantation and dimensions of roofs are determinant factors in computing solar irradiation.
                }
            \end{figure}
            Another big environemental issue that affects cities is air pollution.
            Indeed, it has serious implications on human health as demonstrated in~\textcite{pascal2013assessing} and~\textcite{chen2013evidence}.
            In order to understand its dynamics, researchers simulate the local air flow (\textit{i.e.} the city microclimate) using computational fluid dynamics.
            This requires a detailed knowledge of the scenes layout.
            One way to acquire this information is through \index{urban!\gls{acr::3d}!model}\gls{acr::3d} models of urban settlements~\parencite{ujang2013unified}.
       
        \subsubsection{Autonomous navigation related challenges}
            Autonomous navigation has seen a great technological leap in recent years.
            Localization is an important step in visual navigation~\parencite{bonin2008visual}.
            \Gls{acr::3d} models play an important role in visual localization~\parencite{piasco2018survey, ijgi4042842}.\\
            The basic idea is to match an image with a (textured or not) with a known \gls{acr::3d} model of the city~\parencite{arth2015instant, ardeshir2014gis, cham2010estimating, christie2016semantics} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig::navigation}.
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::navigation} Position estimation using on \gls{acr::2d5} models of urban scenes.
                    This is possible through image pairing with these models.
                }
            \end{figure}
            Once the image matched, one can retrieve an absolute 6-\gls{acr::dog} pose estimation.
            This is especially helpfull in urban canyons as shown in~\textcite{piasco2018survey}.\\
            This can be applied also for indoor environements, such as social cues aware robots navigating alongside humans~\parencite{gupta2018social} or industrial grade robots\addref.
       
        \subsubsection{Entertainement related challenges}
            \gls{acr::3d} models appeals also to various agents in the entertainement industry.
            One of the first examples that comes to mind is the video games community~\parencite{watson2008procedural}.
            In their seek of reality, in order to engage the most customers as possible, studios reproduce entire cities as a virtual playing ground for the game story.
            We can cite the "Spider-Man" virtual New-York city\footnote{
                \href{https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/25/4702318/under-the-hood-of-infamous-second-son-hyper-real-seattle}{Under the hood of Infamous: Second Son's hyper-real Seattle}
            }\footnote{
                \href{https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/12/17453588/spider-man-ps4-new-york-city-avengers-demo-preview}{How Spider-Man PS4’s New York City compares to the real thing}
            } or the realistic facsimile of Seattle in "Infamous Second Son"\footnote{
                \href{http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/spider-man-ps4-new-york-city-2018-9}{I'm blown away by the virtual New York City of 'Spider-Man' on PlayStation 4 — here's how it compares to the real thing}
            } as instances of such use.\\
            Tourism can also benefit from such models.
            In fact, virtual touring has become more attainable with works like~\textcite{koutsoudis20073d}.
            For instance, tourists can use it to prepare their trip by familiarizing themselves with the city they are visiting.
            This can be possible through mixed or augmented reality as shown by~\textcite{devaux20183d}.
            It can also be employed in the service of art.
            Actually,~\textcite{aubry2014painting} and~\textcite{russell2011automatic} illustrated how it is possible to align paintings or photographs with \gls{acr::3d} scenes.\\
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::augemented_reality} Alex devaux.
                }
            \end{figure}
            This last work could be also used to help marketers sell living units.
            Indeed, customers can, for example, visit a digitally reconstructed appartement and virtually furnish it~\parencite{kim2019planar}.
            Another application is living unit pricing.
            In fact, one would not have to travel to the asset location in order to assess it.
            Markerters can do so using its \gls{acr::3d} model.
            For instance, one of the determining factors in estimating buildings is the fa\c{c}ade visibility.
            The latter can be simply measured using building models, as shown by~\textcite{albrecht2013assessing}.

        \subsubsection{Security related challenges}
            Security and emergency fields are not the exception when it comes to the utilization of city \gls{acr::3d} models~\parencite{kwan2005emergency, ruppel2011designing}.
            For instance,~\textcite{chen2014application} shows how these models could be used for ladder trucks optimal deployement planning by firefighters.
            It can also be used to determine safe margins in the case of bomb disposal operations.
            This can be possible through explosion simulation in the urban environement of interest~\parencite{willenborg2015simulation}.\\
            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::explosion_simulation} Explosion simulation in urban environements.
                }
            \end{figure}
            Security forces can equally benefit from the same models.
            \gls{acr::3d} models can be used to help analysing crime scenes~\parencite{wolff2009towards}.
            It can also be helpfull for crime prevention as proved by~\textcite{wolff2008geospatial}.
            These models could be instrumental in military applications~\textcite{zlatanova2002trends, budroni2010automatic}.
            Military forces could, indeed, use building \gls{acr::3d} model based augmented reality to train for intervention scenarii, such as hostage rescue operations.

    \subsection{Building \gls*{acr::3d} modeling}
        \label{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::building_3d_modeling}
        We have seen, previously, how city \gls{acr::3d} models can be instrumental.
        They have a large range of applications in entertainement, industry, security, urbanization and sustainable developpement.
        In this work, th focus is on outdoor, rather than indoor, modeling.\\
        We will raise, herein, the issue of outdoor city modeling.
        We will see how building reconstruction has a prominent role in the field.
        Afterwhat, we will discuss different building model acquisition techniques and how it influences their quality.
        We end with an examination of semantics in building models and the various used modeling strategies.

        \subsubsection{Outdoor city modeling}
            Urban environements are dynamic in nature~\parencite{Vanhoey:2017:VVS:3084363.3085085}.
            However, objects, in this environement, do not evolve with uniform speed.
            We can distinguish, in fact, urban objects depending on their change rate.
            Pedestrians --- and all living animals in general --- and transportation vehicles are in perpetual movement.
            Water bodies and vegetation, in urban scenes, evolve with an annual or seasonal period.
            Last comes city furniture, roads, bridges, buildings and terrain which have a much lower change frequency.\\

            Besides being technically hard, there are ethical and legal issues when reconstructing human and vehicle \gls{acr::3d} models.
            In fact, an exact reconstruction, that is conform to reality, would involve indentifying persons.
            This is an intricate subject as proven by~\textcite{tavani2011ethics} and~\textcite{thornton2010individual}.
            On the other hand, city models can be populated by generic \gls{acr::cad} models of these two objects.
            Usually, these models are even impractical when studying some subjects.
            For instance,~\textcite{lovaas1994modeling} can simulate pedestrian traffic flow, which is inherently a \gls{acr::2d} problem\footnote{
                We can safely assume that human do not fly in 2019.
            }, without requiring \gls{acr::3d} human models.\\
            There is little or no work, as far as we know, that is interested in water body \gls{acr::3d} modeling in urban areas.
            Vegetation can be modeled in details using \gls{acr::lidar} acquisition~\parencite{omasa20063d}.
            It is, however, too demanding in ressources and pointless for a large scale reconstruction of urban scenes.
            They are usually modeled by some template ellipsoidal form model tree as in~\textcite{lafarge_ijcv12} or by default species dependent \gls{acr::cad} models like in~\textcite{iovan2008detection}.\\
            Terrain relief can be modeled simply from the \gls{acr::dsm}.
            Roads are simple planar structures (in reality, they are usually sloped towards the gutter on both sides).
            Still, they are not so easy to detect~\parencite{mnih2010learning}.
            On the other hand, city furniture, bridges and buildings are complex objects to model in \gls{acr::3d}.
            While detailed models that are close to reality can be needed for buildings and bridges, the same cannot be said about city furniture.
            Indeed, it is, for instance, pointless to model a single taffic signal; one would only need to detect its semantics before modeling it by its \gls{acr::cad} model.\\

            In terms of land cover, the most occuring objects in an urban environement are roads, vegetation and buildings \addref.
            Modeling these three objects becomes vital in order to obtain a viable urban \gls{acr::3d} model.
            We have seen previously how roads and vegetation could be easier to model than buildings.
            One can, thus, understand why building modeling can be seen as the most important feature to model in an urban scene.

        \subsubsection{Building model acquisition}
            Building modeling could be divided in two classes depending on the reconstruction scale (\textit{cf.} Figure~\ref{fig::bim_vs_gis}).
            At a small scale, \gls{acr::bim} or \gls{acr::cad} models could be used.
            On the contrary, \gls{acr::gis} models are more suitable at a large scale.\\

            \gls{acr::bim} models are volumetric in nature.
            Each element is represented by a volumetric primitive.
            These models are bottom-up.
            They are manually constructed as blueprints of a building before its construction.
            These models are supposed to follow the buildings evolution in time until its destruction.
            It is the most detailed possible virtual representation of a building.\\
            However, it does not come without its own issues.
            First, we can see that it rules out all buildings that preceded technology, especially, historical buildings.
            Secondly, since this type of models require a high interaction with users, in order to follow the state of the real buildings, it would be almost impossible that the model does not diverge from the reality\addref.
            Last but not least, are the geometrical issues, like self-intersetions, that these models display as most \gls{acr::bim} tools do not perform geometric sanity checks.\\

            \begin{figure}[htpb]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{example-image}            
                \caption{
                    \label{fig::bim_vs_gis} BIM vs GIS.
                }
            \end{figure}

            On an other note, \gls{acr::gis} models, in contrast, represent rather the surface of buildings.
            The goal is to describe building geometry, as well as all urban itmes, at a large scale.
            Furthermore, this model type carries semantics related to the urban objects present in the scene and their relations.
            These models could be acquired manually, as with \gls{acr::bim}, like the example of~\textcite{ref3dnat}.
            Another way to proceed consists in acquiring the geometry automatically or interactively using sensor data~\parencite{musialski2013survey}.
            Crowdsourcing could be used also as a large scale building modeling tool as depicted in~\textcite{uden2013open}.\\

            Some works tackled the issue of bridging the two model acquisition types~\parencite{deng2016mapping}.
            This field is far from being fully mature as proved in~\textcite{stoter2018geo}.
            There are, in addition to the geometric inconsistancies that emanate from \gls{acr::bim} and \gls{acr::gis} models mapping,~\textcite{stoter2018geo} shows that ambiguities thwart automatic conversion from one format to an other.

    \subsection{Obstacles in Building \gls{acr::3d} modeling}
        \label{subsec::introduction::urban_3d_reconstruction::challenges}
        Widely studied in more than 20 years.\\
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Automatizing modeling. Needs manual corrections in high lods. Indoor open + facade parsing still active.
            \item trade-off fidelity vs compactness/semantics.
            \item Change detection in models.
            \item Crowdsourcing.
            \item Scale-space exploration: F Lafarge(JURSE) G Toya\& Marion dumont.
            \item Robustness to input noise.

    \subsection{Geometric consistancy inspection}
        Hugo ledoux, Gisquière. LoD detection.
    \subsection{Manual inspection}
        Once valid geometry. How good is the model? how close to reality?
        IGN case.
        expensive in man power. Not scalable.
    \subsection{Automatic evalutation}
        No one does. Only global error metrics. No semantics. No error localisation.
\section{Contributions}
    \label{sec::introduction::contributions}
    \subsection{Positioning}
        Structure properties => fidelity metrics insufficient
        No geometric issues studied here.
        Semantic evaluation: categorization of errors.
        Errors independent from: LoD, modeling method and urban scene.
